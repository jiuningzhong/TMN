L-I,a better theory is like how an ants or whatever are working or somthing couse you can wach videos
L-I,my theory do you know energy carries all the time right now energy is being carried from a plant to little animal to big animal back to little animal to soil and it repeats agian and again
L-I,my theory i think worker ants do most of the work the worker ants would be building the ant hill i agree that the ant hills would be made out of dirt too
L-I,my theory if ants build ant houses and they carrie the grains of sand won't they fall of
L-I,my theory if you need any ideas dont water the ants ants could die if waters hits ants build just a few ant hills because thousands of ants live in one ant hill
L-I,my theory is i think if you wanna see if it is a living it has to grow somthing and need water to live new information a non living thing does not need water to survive
L-I,my theory is if a venomous or poisonous animal eats another venomous or poisonous animal some will survive and some will maybe die some animals eat venomous or poisonous animal as a food sourse but maybe another animal can't survive it
L-I,my theory is if you crush a seed and give it water soil and sun it will grow
L-I,my theory is it flips over
L-I,my theory is many apples rot because the weather is changing
L-I,my theory is maybe that the male might become king of the ants
L-I,my theory is over time i think that the stem of the apple gets weaker and weaker and sometimes the wind might blow the apple off the tree and probably some animals nock them off too
L-I,my theory is that a bird or animal flys over and drops it into the courtyard and then lays eggs that make more spider which make more and more and more until they go exsticked or the eco system dies
L-I,my theory is that air works to clean up are ecostyem by blowing dead leaves away or to barry it
L-I,"my theory is that an anthill is prepared by worker ants that are strong like not ants that are just born a better theory is that the queen ant could get a part of a different colony who the queen says in ant language could say ""build me an anthill """
L-I,my theory is that animanles clime under ground to the court yard and eat bugs and frogs other animales to how do all those other animanles
L-I,my theory is that birds carry them over
L-I,my theory is that i usually see moss on the dark areas of trees so i am thinking it forms on dark areas i also think it forms when its dewy and wet
L-I,my theory is that if a predetor is close it will turn over to blend in
L-I,my theory is that if moss dies out then it will create a problem wave in the ecosydom many animals will die and plants will to because it provides water on those hot days when there is no water
L-I,my theory is that it will still live but it cant do thing as fast it will walk way slower and it may die because it cant get to food on time
L-I,my theory is that jaguars don't really eat chimpanzees and that people from africa don't kill and eat jaguars but i think that chimpanzees might eat ants good work overall
L-I,my theory is that mabye 2 grass hoppers went arcross the top of the building and had a lot of kids grass hoppers and thats how this theory cannot explain how the grass hoppers made it across
L-I,my theory is that maybe plantsmake food the roots also need air so they can get nutrients and plants need air they use the carbon dioxide in the air for water because there is 1% of water in air it is called photosynthesis some info from google
L-I,new information all ants have different jobs as they grow they get darker ants go faster since they have tiny legs there can be a thousands of ants in a anthill if a ant get feed the right things they can be a queen
L-I,new information almost every ecosystem needs soil for their environment soil is a massive help towards growing plants and being homes towards many insects without soil plants wouldn't grow and the food web would go wack without all the producers plants
L-I,new information almost every ecosystem needs water to grow its enviornment and its whole species every animal needs water plants need it in order to grow too without plants in the food chain it would go wack making a species over populated and then go extinct
L-I,new information i learned is that abiotic means decomposition by a chemical process and that biotic means decomposition of living orgonisms
L-I,new information peat is formed by decaying moss and plants this is important because peat is a fuel it can be used for fertilizer burn for fuel and eventually it becomes coal
L-I,new information the sun provides humankind with light and heat to create new earth habitate it also provides plants to grow to help the food chain sunlight also helps with weather which weather helps ecosystems too sunlight can cause droughts when there is less rain and intense rain
L-I,new information you can tell how old a tree is if you cut it open a bit you see circles 1 circle for every year
L-I,new information when ants die the other ants leave it alone but after two days they carry it to the ant graveyard they do this because after two days it starts to smell which gives signals to the ants that it is dead
L-I,blockquote i learned that the food chain is what connects animals my theory is that the food chain is in regions because pandas are only in asia so something in antarica can't eat it a better theory i have is that somehing in both places can connect them mabey something that live in one place gets eaten by something tat lives there and in another place and that animal gets eaten by anther animal blockquote
L-I,a plant can grow without real sunlight but if you dont have real sunlight it has to grow withartificial sunlight lamp light night light but a plant can not grow without sunlight
L-I,a species is a group of organisms that are so alike they classify as a group to be a type of species the organisms have to be able to reproduce for example a mule is not a species because it is not able to reproduce
L-I,air+water+sunlight=wind water makes clouds and if you add too much wind you'll make a thunderstorm or atornado
L-I,all moss needs to havespores to live causethat is how water and air gets into the mossor the plant
L-I,all plants usesunlightto make food sugars in a process called photosynthesis
L-I,another reason why living things need energy is because if you donÂ´t eat you can starve and cannot live
L-I,ants are super strong so they dig the hole quiqly even after it gets destroyed
L-I,apples fall off the trees in winter because they get weak
L-I,atoms are small particles building blocks that are everywhere they are made up of a central dense nucleus which is surrounded by one or some more lightweight negativity charged particles that are called electrons
L-I,carbon is everything without carbon there would be no universe
L-I,decomposersbreak down the remains of dead plants and animals and in doing so releasecarbon dioxidethrough respiration
L-I,energy can come from the sun and fossil fules and the suns energy is the main source of life like the plants convert it into food for them and then an anamail comes along and eats the plant and absobs the energy
L-I,first apple trees need sun light to grow and the rain then it keeps growing and growing untill it becomes a big apple tree with tasty apples on it
L-I,flamingos are born gray but they eat a type of plant and a type of mineral in the plant turns the flamigo pink it should be the same with ants
L-I,i agree with varsha becasue i onlny see moss on tree bark and the ground dirt
L-I,i agree with you because trees and plants can not live with out chlorophyll
L-I,i also think that the moss grows to the north because the north is colder and moss usually grows in cool and wet conditions
L-I,i also think that the moss is effected by the tree position
L-I,i can add on to that beacuse when the weather is putting the pressure on to the apple and making it fall off the tree its like when someone were to push you off the edge of a pool the pressure of the person pushing you is putting impact on your boby and therefore making you fall into the pool also i agree with you saying that if a person were sick its like an apple slowly rotting because it dosn't have the nutrients to grow off of
L-I,i can add on to that because when weather puts the pressure on the matter it can make it transfer into a different shape or fall apart like if there was a tsunami the waves are so strong that they can make houses and buildings fall apart and it can squish cars and make them flat or put them into a different shape or like when you pour water into a cup it takes the form of the cup
L-I,i dissigry they carry sand one by one i think
L-I,i don't think plants have energy i think they have nurtrients that turns in to fuel energy for the thing thats eats them
L-I,i don't think the moss will die out because when moss dies it will become rich soil for new mosses and plants to grow
L-I,i dont think metal ever lived
L-I,i dont think so because what if a bee died in it
L-I,i learned tha there are over 12 000 types of ants also they are soical insects witch mean they move in larage groups
L-I,i noticed that maybe only some trees have moss growing to the north maybe like a compass moss will grow to the north because there is something there what is that something
L-I,i predict that the moss on the ground will keep growing if it gets water and sun or else it will die my theory is that the cold weather and the rain will keep it alive or the rain will sit there and the cold will freeze it
L-I,i think once the ivy interacts with the skin it will infect the outside layer of skin and the interaction will cause an infection from bolth the ivy and the skin and that will create the rash
L-I,i think that the weather is making the apples fall down beacause the wind is putting preser on the apple my theory is that when the apples fall down they rot because they don't get the nuterents they need i need to understand that the applesare like people if the don't get there nutrents they get sick
L-I,i think that there is nutrients in thing animals eat that give them energy if they can't get energy they might be a canirvor if it's a plant because they can't convert those nutrients
L-I,i think you miss understand what spores are spores are kind of like the seeds for moss exept thereÂ´re microscphic
L-I,i think your 2 answer is correct and that it is probably a different type of moss
L-I,if a feamle ants eat the right food they turn into queen ants
L-I,if an ant eats the right kind of food it can become a queen ant
L-I,in photosynethesis the plant will use energy from the sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into simple sugars a plant needs water and sunlight for food
L-I,in the daytime the hot air comes from the river and than it goes up in the air and than the cold air replaces it in the courtyard when its about to be winter the nights are cold but in the summer the nights are worm by the ways the air cycle in the daytie is the opposite of the air cycle in the nightime
L-I,is that the green side might be for camofloging with the leef and brown side for sand
L-I,it interacts with humans because if it is contagous than it can spred around if you tuch it
L-I,it probably grew like that over time maybe something happened to it
L-I,leaves absorbe the sun light and water and creates the suger that it uses to live
L-I,maybe a cherry tree or some type of trees full of fruits
L-I,maybe small animals like ants for a nest or a birdwhen the moss is on the tree the bird might use it for it's nest
L-I,maybe the ant that eats the right food will not be the king because it dosen't lay babies but it can lead the other ants to find another group with a queen
L-I,maybe there is somethingattracting the moss so it goes north
L-I,mosquioes are the most different creature on the planet because its one of the only living creature carry diseases
L-I,moss only grows on the northern side of tress if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere the moss grows on the southern side of trees
L-I,moss will grow better in damper places because it takes in all the water in the air
L-I,most animals need water to survive water allows metabolism occur which is the process that drives all the biochemical reaction that take places in cells
L-I,most likely it would not grow just because that the roots are whatstartthe process for the tree to grow my theory mostly is that the tree will not grow anymore but will still live unless you cut it or it falls
L-I,my theory is you can feel the sun on you even if itÅ far away because the rays give off a whole lot of energy the sun reflects on a cloud and a cloud shoots to the ground like a mirror
L-I,my theroy is that white soil interacts with the plants the same as brown regular does because i have observed no change between either white soil or regular brown soil my hypothisis is that they are just diffrent colors and i do not think that that change makes a diffrence of how they grow
L-I,no because metal is not madde out of anything living
L-I,noah another term is apex prdetor wich means top of the food web
L-I,out side in the courtyard i found a brick wih a small patch of moss in the middle of the brick touching no other patches of moss i need to understand how the moss lives this theory cannot explain because i have not gatherd enough informaition
L-I,photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to create foods from carbon dioxide and water
L-I,photosynthesis is the process used by plants algae and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy here we describe the general principles of photosynthesis and highlight how scientists are studying this natural process to help develop clean fuels and sources of renewable energy
L-I,poison in poison ivy poison oak and poison sumac is called urushiol and it is used to protect the plant never burn the plant because if the urushiol gets in the air and you breathe it in it will most likely kill you
L-I,rhizoids are the super thin roots that hold the moss in place they arenÂ´t very strong so you could pick it up without struggle
L-I,serena an egg is clear then it turns white when it is older then the baby is clear and gets its colors when it's oldercamryn a baby is clear till it gets older than they turn a dark brown
L-I,some caterpillars like monarchs eat milkweed leaves so that they can scare there predators off and so they dont get eaten
L-I,some flowers are very sweetsmelling and they originally grew thorns to protect themselves from animals that may try to eat them so my theory is that they they may have been for protection like you said
L-I,spiders eat insects and get eaten by birds and fish so spiders are first level predators but not apex predators
L-I,spores are carried by the wind then it grows into moss
L-I,"the apple rots because the enrgery from the tree put it into the apple when it was on the tree and when said apple fell off of the tree it didn't get any more ""food"" from the tree so it will rot and die then posibly get eaten"
L-I,the bettle has a brown side for camiflouge and the green side is for that if camiflouge fails it can turn around to show the brigh green side to try to scare away the preadator
L-I,the energy is still being produced because if it stoped the tree would die the leaves are probably are getting weak and dry because the cold
L-I,the female moquitos spit on your skin to num up your skin were it smells looks sweeet and suger filled and then they put their sharp nose in your skin and find a blood vesel and suck out your blood
L-I,the freezing and cold tempretures will kill the moss and the rain will help it grow
L-I,the plant also useswater from rain and carbon for the process to work for the gluocose like a cooking recipe
L-I,there are diffrent types of moss such asiron moss wich will only grow on thigs with heavy amounts of iron on it my theory is that the moss only sticks to certain things your friend sienna
L-I,there can be a lot of different animals new information insects are anials too if insect are animals there is so many types of animals like grass hoppers ants mousqutioand other different insects
L-I,they give plants energy and animals eat that plant so they get energy and so on
L-I,they need sugar so they could make fruits and my question is how do the plants make sugarphoto=light and synthesis=putting toghetherleaves have tiny pores called stomata so carbon dioxide can enter the plant
L-I,toads can burrow if there is a predotor or a emergency maybe thats where toads go when its winter under ground
L-I,when do the mosquitos stop drinkings the blood well that's a good question etheir the mosquito's stomach gets full or it gets spotted and flys away quickly or dies because it got swatted by somebody
L-I,when the apple falls from the tree it gets a bruise then the decomposers build o to the bruise and takes the energy from the apple then the apple rots
L-I,when the apples fall they interact with the air because the apple is falling through the air when it falls to the ground it is interacting with leaves over time the apple will interact with decomposers the decomposers interact with the apple by eating it so it get rotten
L-I,when they dig the ants push dirt out to make tunnles witch makes a ant hill like when you dig with a tunnle
L-I,when they fall of the tree than they cant grow any more like a human when a human eats and than grows and you grow till you cant grow any more than advetually die so thats the same with apples
L-I,why are baby ants white when their born and then they turn to their regular ant colony color and not just be born the same color as their ant colony what i did learn though is that when the ants are born they have no legs and can't do anything without the help of the other ant or so called worker ants my theory is if the baby ants are born without legs and can't do anything by itself maybe that has to do with why its color is white also if their decomposers maybe something from that equals to why the baby abts are born white and if they eat te right type of foods they can turn to their regular coloies colors
L-I,yes my theory is yes during oter sesings in winter ther fur might white or oter colers
L-I,"image kf6 rit albany edu manual_assets kf4images iconnoteunreadothr gif"" missing link "" link contribution by missing authors when a tardigrade is dry up it starts to synthesize special molecules which fill the tardigrades cells to replace lost water by forming a matrix a matrix is like a net the marix keeps cells from the tardigrade from moving or combining"
L-I,a better theory i think ant hills are living because the are in are ecosystem and they are ecsposed to air to live
L-I,my theory a daddy long legs fangs are to short to bite people but there tails are have been so deadly with venom
L-I,my theory is that maybe the berries are a source of food to the stink bugs and that's why they were all over the berries
L-I,my theory is that moss lets go clusters of seeds into the air and let the wind carry it away
L-I,my theory is that spiders can climb up walls because they shoot a spider web up and climb it and the web is sticky
L-I,my theory is that the enviormet is good here at this time
L-I,my theory is that the ground hog that we saw might live here in guilderland because there are nutrients maybe here so that is why i am searching wy groundhogs live in guilderland this theory cannot explain why ground hogs live in guilderland
L-I,my theory is that the moss might have got stuck on the brick somehow and there might have some water on it that might keep it sticking if you look in google how it gets stuck on the brick and gets nutrients from it might help
L-I,my theory is that there are all kinds of diffrent cattipilers but there is only one kind that i know that is piosenes and it is white with black spikes and it is really cool iv seen one or two before and thoes are the most dangoures cattipilers that i know
L-I,my theory is that there is oil on the poison ivy that makes you ich and there is alot of diffrent ways it can get in any were at any time at any place
L-I,my theory is that they are poisonis because they eat stuff that makes them poison is
L-I,my theory is that they eat anamals that cant hert them that much
L-I,my theory is that they go down deep so preditors will not eat them
L-I,my theory is that they need food to survive
L-I,my theory is that they need there fur to survive and water food
L-I,my theory is that they still could live because they would still have a lot of their legs and most likely 2 legs would not through them of ballance
L-I,my theory is that weather is a super strong force that uses lots of different matter like wind water houses and more weather can c hh znge a lot of things like people if it always snowed no crops could grow and all living things would die out
L-I,my theory is the apple fell of the tree and the decomposers eat the apple and the apple got less energy and rotted
L-I,my theory is the spider might still live for ages because a spider needs equal legs
L-I,my theory is the thorns are usedto keep plant eating animals away we should work together on this wondering
L-I,my theory is there might have been nutrients on the bery so that must be why
L-I,my theory is they might crall over the school like going on it and crall on to the roof to go in the courtyard
L-I,my theory is apples fall because of gravity the apple falls when it gets ripe once it is ripe it gets weak around the stem and the gravity pulls it down to the ground
L-I,my theory is toads do not go undergrond because they do not go undergrondthey go into a state of hibernation and somecanbe exposed to temperatures below freezing aquatic
L-I,my theory is that the white and black catipiller is piosonous but some one else thinks there is another black and white catipiller in florida but i disagree
L-I,my theory it is probably damp there to because it is dark and that stops the sun from drying it so maybe it grows in dark and damp places
L-I,my theory mosquitos are the most deady creatures in the world they can cary thousands of deiseases
L-I,my theory moss grows on the north side of trees because water evaporates on the north side of the tree in the southern hemisphere water evaporates on the south side of trees
L-I,my theory my theory is that ants find the hills and just put hole and the top the dont build the hills
L-I,my theory of why the stinkbugs are not moving when they are on the berries is maybe they want it as their source of food and the stinkbugs don't want the other stinkbugs getting over the berries also maybe since it's getting colder the stinkbugs want to get as much food as they can because it will be a lot colder and the stinkbugs will lose their sources of food
L-I,my theory poison is used to scare predetors away or else the predotor will dye slowly
L-I,my theory seeds are living matter because seeds in apples are like unborn children they dont grow but when they get the right treatment they grow into a huge apple tree
L-I,my theory that plants don't have energy in them they have nutrients and ogranisoms that eat them that eat plants get the nutrients into energy to move and do other stuff animals that don't don't get the energy
L-I,my theory mosquitos are the most deadly animals in the world they cary thousands of diseases
L-I,my theory moss does not only grow on the north side of trees moss grows on the north side of trees if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere the reason for this because the sun hits the north side of trees so water evaporates so moss grows if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere it grows on the south side
L-I,my theory wonce one gets in it lays eggs whitch makes more and one probibly crawled on the roo
L-I,my theory grasshoppers go through 4 stages of their life cycle egg nymph adult grasshoppers and death a nymph looks like a little adut grasshopper but with out wings
L-I,my theory i think the worms use the slime on their bodies help them to move around in the soil
L-I,my theory is that it's wind
L-I,my theory is that the plant starts to dies when the soil becomes more unheathly or they can't get the minerals that they need
L-I,new information moss seedless spores the wind carriess the spores throw the air and if it is in the right codistion then it will land on ground and it will grow the plant called moss
L-I,anthony female mosquitos are the only mosquitos that drink blood because they need nutrients for their eggs male mosquitos are harmless and instead eat nectar
L-I,i agree with owian but i think that the ants do a few grains of sand dirt at a time
L-I,i agree with serena because the plants made no progress over the weekend so i will also check with serena if the plants made any progress on the 7th of december and\or 10th of december
L-I,i noticed that ants were crawling around sand and there was a ant hole i need to understand how living underground impacts ants and what impacts ants living underground my theory is that snow and rain impacts ants living underground by bringing the ant hole down also does warm weather impact ants living underground also
L-I,i noticed that moss does not have seeds i need to understand that why does moss grow if it does not have seeds so it can grow my theory is moss is growing because a reaction that supposedly it makes moss grow
L-I,i noticed that moss was growing on the trees i need to understand why does moss grow on the tree my theory maybe the weather effects the moss or the light
L-I,i noticed that some plants in the courtyard are rotting i need to understand what causes living plants to interact with the rotting plants my theory is that the rotting plants decay into the soil and the living plants use the soil to grow
L-I,i noticed that the moss was get larger and larger as it spread i need to understand how and why does moss spread to other things around it my theory is that moss spread more cause it grows to the round and evantually reaches other objects
L-I,i noticed that there was more moss on the sides of the boards on the bench then on the top i need to understand if the moss grows better in the shade than in the sun my theory is that the moss needs to be in a dark and moist place this might be why it sometimes grows on wood
L-I,i noticed that when the wind blow the leaves fell off the tree i need to understand why the weather effects living and nonliving matter in the ges ecosytem my theory is thay when the weather puts presure on the matter like hail rain or wind the matter falls flattens or moves like when you get pushed you fall forward
L-I,i noticed the apple tree had some leaves that were green and some were yellow i need to understand why the leaves are different colors i know the temperature is getting cooler does that impact the way the tree changes my theory is that the leaves will eventually get so old they turn colors like my hair is so old it has turned gray
L-I,i think a few years at most
L-I,i think berry trees have red stuff on it
L-I,i think moss forms in dark areas because it grows on dark spot on trees
L-I,i think spiders climb walls by gripping into cracks with their legs
L-I,in other cases there would be making it moss because i just realized that moss cant grow seeds but plants can
L-I,the sun will allways be a mystriye because nobody has even gotten anywhere near the sun without dieing
L-I,well jack you see air you see it everywhere and air s everthing and plus air is the first thing that you see in the morning when you wake up
L-I,i need to understand what will happen to the north and south poles when there is too much carbon dioxide my theory i know that when there is too much carbon dioxide the whole world will heat up which will cause a greenhouse effect a better theory when there is too much carbon dioxide inside the earths mantle the carbon dioxide will push the lava up to earth and cause a volcano eruption new information first the humans breathe out carbon dioxide than the trees and water soak up the carbon dioxide than breathe out the trees and water are called carbon soakers because they take in more carbon than they breathe out i need to understand how much carbon dioxide we need to keep in order to keep the world balanced
L-I,my theory adhityablack ants live in colonies and anthills black ants are mostly nice but not so aggressive like red ants and red and black ants mostly bite alot it causes a infection fire antsare omnivorous known toeatmeats greasy and sweet materials fire antsare omnnivores meaning they will feed on animal or vegetable sources offood thefireant worker's diet includes insects earthworms ticks spiders arthropod eggs honeydew and other sweets this picture here is a leaf cutter antthe ant is a very successful member of the insect group and has always been a topic of interest due to its complex colony a profile on the ant explains the complexity of the ant colony and why it is often referred the size and distribution of ant populations is presented along with information on the ant's senses and a detailed description of the ant's life cycle information on the ant's antennae is included as well as information on the ant's strength walking paths and social behavior image kf6 rit albany edu attachments 5b87586745b8a02554df72de 5bdc50785182ad5cff2b5c0c 1 blob link mnn com earthmatters animals blogs crazyfactsleafcutterants ant wikipedia link en wikipedia org wiki ant click on the ant wikipedia to learn some more
L-I,new information ants affect nutrients in the soil by moving through it to build nests and move food this is good for the ecosystem what is more important is the population of ants when the population of ants decreases the population of other species increases because the ants are very aggressive my theory the nutrients that the ants bring to the soil helps plants to grow i need to understand how the nutrients get there from the ants and how does it help
L-I,new information bryophytes are actually a seedless plants they do not need seed pollenaters or photosynthesis to grow moss liverworts and hornworts or all types of seedless plants usally they live in wet and dewy habitats this is how they grow a moss gives out seeds called spores that travel inair and lands onsome surface the seed that lands on a surface will soon grow into a moss
L-I,new information that we found was that articles and videos might not be true which is why we need to do experiments in the experiment we found out that the tounge is not made up with separterate taste buds in separterate areas we found this out by taking qtips and dip it in 4 different subtunces sour lemon juice sugar salt and bitter coffee shown a diagram of different parts of the tounge and have to put the dipped in qtip on the part you have to log it on a paper if you can taste it or not in the end we shared our results and made a conclusion that the tounge is not made up of seperterate taste buds which means that not all article videos arenÂ´t always true
L-I,new information that i have found is the leaves are green beacause of chorophyll chorophyll is green it absorbs the sunlight and water the help to make sugar for the tree plants use chorophyll to make food also leaves have things inside them called pigments which are colored red yellow orange and also purple you can't see them because during the summer there is so much chorophyll it overrides it but during the fall there is less sunlight and the chorophyll slowly starts to fade and thats why the leaves change color
L-I,all birds have feathers for different reasons like the penguins have feathers to keep warm chickens have feathers because they also need to keep warm they also need them to flutter up to places only a few feet above the ground turkeys need feathers also to flutter up to places and to keep warm and penguins have a thick layer of blubber under their feathers to keep warm in the extreme cold
L-I,before the btb was blue because it had no carbon dioxide once we blew human air into it it turned green because human air has c02 when we put a plant into the btb it turned green because plants take in carbon dioxide and the plant took in the carbon dioxide and made it turn back to blue
L-I,decompoition is in the naturle process by which large organic materials and molecules are broken down into simpler ones the ultimante products of decompoition are simple molecules such as carbon dioxid water decompoition is actually an extremly vital ecological process
L-I,decomposers and sravengers that break down the dead plants and animals they also break down the waste scat of other organisms decomposers are very important to any ecosystem if they weren't in the ecosystem the plants would not get the essential nutrients and then the dead matter and waste would pile up source can't remember the title of the artical
L-I,decomposers are the f b i the f stands for fungus b stands for bacteria and the i stands for insects decomposers are like little cleaners of nature they decompose until whatever they are decomposing into carbon dioxide oxygen &amp water
L-I,first of all the cycle starts off as a seed then the seed gets carbon dioxide water sunlight to grow after it gets all of those things the seed turns into a small tree and grows out of the ground this is when the tree also starts to grow roots after this step the small tree turns into an apple tree this is when the tree grows apples after the tree starts getting weak it loses its apples when the apples fall to the ground and die the seeds are exposed they go back in the ground or the wind blows them away and moves them to some place else this is how the cycle keeps on going
L-I,i know that ants are decomposers when they eat they leave a trail of left over bits of food that add nutrients to the soil i know that ants are aggressive i learned that the ant population can impact the population of other species in an area if the ant population goes down other species in that area will go up my theory if an ant population goes up other species'population will go down many ants work together to 'take out' other species a better theory without ants and other decomposers the soil would not get nutrients without the nutrients inthe soil the plants that grow there would not get what they need to grow strong with nutrients then the animals that eat the plants won't have the best nutrients they need humans who eat the animals that eat the plants won't get the nutrients they need to get bigger and stronger and survive in healthy ways ants are an interesting and important species i need to understand what are the nutrients in the soil that plants and animals and humans need
L-I,i learned that at first i thought that moss did not have any roots but now i found out that moss actually moss has tiny small roots and that moss is eukaryotic meaning their cells have nucleus that also contain cell wall called cellulose there also autotrophic which means they make their own food they also carry a photosynthesis witch makes carbon carbon dioxide into sugar in order for moss to grow in other places there has to be other moss to send around spores if it lands somewhere with the right temperature than it can grow correctly seedless plants are separated into different groups vascular and nonvascular vascular have canals that carry water throughout their body nonvascular plants or bryophytes instead of collecting water from there roots they collect water though there thin cell walls they donât grow more than a few centimeters tall thin rootlike rhizoids holds the plants down and also absorb water from the ground you will find bryophytes all around the world mostly in rain forests and ponds and streams mosses are the most common bryophytes clumped in layers on tree trunks the ground or even rocks moss and liverworts were the first plants to live harsh places
L-I,i used to think that not alot of insects can live in moss because moss insects are pretty big like a big ant but thereâs a insect called a tardigrade a tardigrade is a insect that lives in or around moss so if a tardigrade can live in moss that mean other insects can live or can they because a tardigrade is microscopic so thereâs a lot of space for the tardigrade now i think that moss canât really provide a home or insects because a ant lives underground so if ants lives on moss when it rain the rain will wash the ants away
L-I,i used to think that the air moves by itself now i know that the sun makes the air move and that the sun has to be in a certain area to push the wind it's the low pressure system as the warm air rises it cools of and eventually sinks back down the system is like a big engine taking in air all around it that gets you a lot of moving air
L-I,i ve learned that all living things are linked together by what they eat for example say if there were no more shrimp the amount animals that eat the shrimp will start to decrease and it would just keep on decreasing also did you know that the food web can contain lost and lots of animals in it the food web has three main elements producers consumers and decomposers producers are plants they make their own food out of the sun also known as photosynthasis the producers are mostly at the bottom of the food chain consumers can't make their own food so they eat the producers primary consumers are herbavors secondary consumers are carnivors and some consumers are omnivors also there are parasite cosumers decomposers are mostly bacteria they help to brake down dead animals or dead plants or any of those dead things
L-I,leaves have unique structures called veins that transport liquids and nutrients to leaf cells veins also carry the products of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree a tree leaf has several types of veins the central one is called the midrib or midvein other veins connect to the midrib and have their own unique patterns tree leaf veins in dicots we also call these trees hardwoods or deciduous trees are all considered to be netveined or reticulateveined this means that the veins branch from the main rib and then subbranch into finer veins there are two classifications you need to
L-I,"like i said already in ""more about moss"" mossmaygrowonly on a north side of a tree if that's the shadiest location as the sun tracks the sky ifthereissomethingelse providing shade or moisture themosswillgrowin those places just as well"
L-I,mosquitoes are part of the food web is because they get eaten by spiders dragon flies and more they are cosumers because they eat plants and obsorb the energy but they get eaten by the animals thet i mentioned
L-I,not all plants have flowers or seeds ferns and mosses are plants but they produce spores fungi or mushrooms also make spores but they are not plants spores on ferns develop under the leaves they look like brown spots but you will need a microscope to see them each type of fern has spores of a different shape some plants reproduce without seeds or spores in a kind of cloning cutting grafting or bulbs can be used to grow new plants
L-I,parts of a plantthe blade is broad and flat a stalk attaches the blade to the stem a simple leaf has one bade and a compond leaf has several blades on the same petiole veins in the leave carry food and water from the leaves to the rest of the plant they also make a strong support that give the leaves its shape the veins of a broad leaf form a netlike pattern the veins of narrow leaves are parallel leaves size are also adapted by habitat and maximize photosynthesis
L-I,photosynthesis occurs when a plant soaks up water through its roots absorbs carbon dioxide co2 through openings in the leaves called stomata and stores energy from sunlight as chemical energy the water travels up the plant's stem through a transport tissue calledxylem the water and co2 spread through the leaves into cells calledthe palisades and the spongy cells the cells are filled with structures called chloroplasts which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll chlorophyll splits the water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen atoms the sunlight chemical energy is used to create glucose from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide the glucose dissolves into extra water molecules and gives the plant an extra boost of energy that it needs to grow the plant gives off the oxygen atoms as a waste product
L-I,"photosynthesis starts off with the sun when the sun is not blocked the sunlight goes to plants and gives the plants energy notes plants make carbon dioxide into sugar from sunlight plants use stuff like air h2o carbon dioxide and sunlight to make there own food when plans make there own food and ""eat"" it they release water"
L-I,photosynthiesis is where a plant turns energy from the sun into glucose for food meanwhile the roots suck up water and take in carbon dioxide andreleases air as a waste product
L-I,so what i learned is that photosnthesis is light tht comes from the sun and rain water and then it mixes it to gether and then creates this suger but its not the suger thats in coockies its a natrule suger ill post a pickture about it
L-I,the blade orlamina is the broad flat part of the leaf photosynthesis occurs in the blade which has many green foodmaking cells leaf blades differ from one another in several ways 1 the types of edges 2 the patterns of the veins and 3 the number of blades per leaf the types of edges almost all narrow grasslike leaves and needles leaves have a blade with a smooth edge as do many broadleaf plants particularly those that are native to warm climates the rubber plant a common house plant is a good example of such a plant the leaves of many temperate broadleaf plants have small jagged points called teeth along the blade edge birch and elm trees have such leaves some plants havehydathodes tiny valvelike structures that can release excess water from the leaf the teeth of young leaves on many plants including cottonwood and pin cherry trees bear tiny glads these glands produce liquids that protect the young leaf from planteating insects some temperate broadleaf plants including sassafras trees and certain mulberry and oak trees have lobed leaves the edge of such a leaf looks as if large bites have been taken out of it this lobing helps heat escape from the leaf
L-I,the food chain of the ants start with ants getting birth then they eat then the chimpanzees eat the ants with their tools like sticks then here comes a big predator called a jaguar then it eats the chimpanzee then here comes the the humans in africa eat the jaguar and leave it on the ground then it decomposes then it goes all over again
L-I,wait hailey i think you are right but the spores are not only for the wind they are also for the moss to grow let me explain it to you as part of the first plant family to colonize earth the soft beds of mosses that now grace mountain streams and woodlands may have shaped our planetâs history primitive mosses similar to the hundreds of moss species found in appalachia might have triggered two cool periods around 455 million years ago according to a recent study published earlier this year in nature geoscience the study suggests that early mosses clinging to prehistoric rocks sped up the weathering of certain minerals from those rocks the release of these minerals accelerated the pace of carbon sequestration leading to cooler temperatures that paved the way for further plant and animal evolution
L-I,why do animals mostly die in the winter and where do they go to hibernate if they do survive i learned why they hibernate because it's cold and the weather through outside animals coming hunt for them so they have to hibernate swag so they have to get food and shelter before other animals do a lot of website to find out what happened to animals is google search the web and chrome it was the most places where you can go other animals eat the snow animals to get more energy for the night period every man for himself and animal from self again some animals hibernate some animals migrate
L-I,wolves don't have alot of predtors as you would think they do because wolves are usally in packs wolves eat most of the following animals elk ox rabbit moose beavers fish musk and many more the predtors of the wolves are bear and mountian lion that's common predtors for the wolves
L-I,new intrimationthat me and dylan discoverd is that ant colines could have millions of ants there are diferent typs of ants theres 1 queen ant worker ants which are females and there are drones who are males when a termite whol is attact army ants spry a substance tat the attaker will not like ants like to eat friut and other small things i need to understand if ants are decomposers the reason i am wondering if ants are decomposers is because if a apple starts to rot and they eat it is that considerd decomposing
L-I,my theory is that rain comes into the mushroom which makes the steam or smoke what this theory cannot explain that mushrooms have no holes i need to understand how it comes to there spores is it moss new information about this from brainpop is that when spores or something does a thing called budding that makes it come off the mushroom not really this makes it in my thinking let the smoke come out when you flick it new information more info i have is that the mushroom is called the puffball mushroom new information as of 12 6 18 they dont spur out steam or smoke new information as of 12 10 the puffball isn't a mushroom it actually is a fungi but isn't a mushroom what new information more the smoke or steam is actualy dust like spores so that means that the smoke is actually spores that look like dust i guess i found the answer to my theory or did i new information i see that they get the spores out from getting impacted like the flick i saw at the albany pinebush i guess that's it here is a picture image kf6 rit albany edu attachments 5b87586745b8a02554df72de 5c0ea49ec0c1561fdba72c41 1 screenshot 20181210 at 12 37 47 pm png c 2018 wikipediaa puffball mushroom
L-I,new information decomposition works when organic substances break down nonliving more simple organic matter foxes deers etc this process helps ecosystems by turning organic matter into enerygy for other plants to grow in soil fungi bacteria and insects are the ones who do this process they're called decomposers
L-I,new information fungi like mushrooms midew andtoadtools are not plants they dont have chorophyllso they cant make their own food fungi release enzymes that decompose dead plants and animals

L-I,new information after what bill said plants are producers and animals that eat plants are herbivores when herbivores eat the plant that plant that has stored energy that goes into an animal willthen the animal have energy as well an animal that eats a herbivore is called a carnivore the energy will go into the carnivore when animals die there is something called decomposers which take the energy from the animal and put it in the soil for new plants to grow there this is called a food web quote from bill nye the science guy food is fuel and energy varsha's add on information
L-I,putting our knowledge together in each ant family ant hill there is one queen ant the queen ant gives birth to babies when the baby ants are born they are usally white as they grow up they turn black thousands and thousands ofants live in one ant hill like an apartment ants eat sweet fruits and other sweet things there are many different kinds of ants ants live everywhere

L-I,bigger animals in the food chain kill smaller animals but smaller animals can kill bigger animals say if there in a pack then they could take down a bigger animal i think fish donât need air to breath because they have some kind of organe in there body that lets them breath in water and have no need for airscientific methods are ways of making there questions better then they were before science should real step up its game by doing other things the courtyard interactions the courtyard interactions and i have been focusing on is the apple tree changing during each season is the tree dead will it have its leaves again the courtyard has a lot of dying stuff including trees animals and grass and plants scientists are working on a solution so plants don't die in the winter i hope it happens why and how do the animales get in the cortyard stop following me i want to be alone

L-I,it might be because they don't have the resources
L-Q,how are they able to find resources
L-I,i think it's because there is not a lot of bodies of water and they have a lot of 3rd world countries that can not afford wells
L-I,some countries don't have the water they need because the dont have the equipment to filter and distribute it to more people
L-I,some countries also don't have much water because of a drout or of a water shortage from a war or hot weather
L-I,today we did a water challenge the challenge was that you had to move 100ml of water 100 centimeters to another beaker the challenge was a bit hard at first but when we got a hang of it
L-Q,i need to understand how would water get to those in need my theory is that you could build underground tubes instead of over ground tubes that way you can deliver watr without it interfearing with roads and buildings
L-I,maybe we can install underground pipes that go to all of the villages and then the water can go through a filter and be cleaned and ready to drink
L-I,so my theroy is that we could we can put water towers in different areas then we put pipes in
L-I,evaporation is water water is steaming
L-I,our plan worked here are our stuff we had 4 tubes 1 3 way valve 6 connectors 2 beakers always and a sringe and a measuring tape
L-I,putting our knowledge together when we worked in teams of 4 3 we made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange
L-I,during this experiment i learned it's kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because you have to come up with a plan etc
L-I,well i guess it could be hard if you did not have a plan but other wise it would not be that hard
L-Q,why does africa's water dry up so quickly
L-I,it was fun to do with classmates and easy it didn't really make a big mess for us my questions are can we go longer and can it get harder cuz what we did was easy
L-Q,i need to understand how filters work
L-Q,i need to understand how do filters work
L-I,starit was esey up thehoill
L-I,my theory is that we used the brown filter first than we used a carben then white filter and 150 0
L-I,our nitrate level was 50 our groups plan is in my section but failure is a road to sucsecion
L-I,they should filter the water if its dirty so it's healthy or add pipes around so it's not as hard to get water
L-Q,why do we have a better water system than other counries what makes it different for them is it because the other countries are hotter than ours like africa
L-I,yeah africa is closer to equator
L-I,what weill happed if you drink too much water will you be fine

L-Q,where did water come from
L-I,water onearthcycles from the oceans where it evaporates from the surface into the atmosphere forms clouds falls onto the land as rain travels through wetlands rivers lakes and underground then returns to the ocean â collectively known as the hydrologic cycle
L-Q,this theory cannot explain ifour water is coming from the ocean water that evaporates and later rains does rain water have salt in it too
L-R,hey tyler a shorter word for water is h2o
L-I,comets transneptunian objects or waterrich meteoroids callled protoplanetsfrom the outer reaches of the asteroid belt colliding with earthmay have brought water to the world's oceans
L-I,where did the earth's watyleter originally come from much ofearth's wateris thought to havecome fromasteroids impacting the planet early in its history image via nasa don davis the surface of the very youngearthwasinitiallyan ocean of magma hydrogen and noble gases from the solar nebula were drawn to the planetary embryo forming the first atmosphere
L-R,image i stack imgur com un7s1 jpg
L-Q,i am wondering if water forms in space what if the hyderojen and oxegen bind then came to earth some how can we make water on earth by binding the two elemnts
L-Q,you cant make water right
L-I,humans impact water pollution in many waysfor one the endless stream of garbage dumped into the ocean a waterfall of plastic bags cans and water bottles are grinding into the beautiful sea life that surrounds our world this pollution is usually the cause of the millions of sea animals that wash up on our shores necks mouths intestines and lungs entwined with plastic because of this will dolphins become extinct manantee's
L-Q,i am wondering what would happen if you instead of having water for two weeks you drank sugar drinks
L-I,my theory is that if you drank only sugar drinks for 2 weeks these could be some of the results *you might get diabetes*your teethmight rot and fall out*you might have a hyperactivity seizure*your organs might get weaker because they had too much sugar energy and shorted out *you would gain a lot of weight*you might get dehydrated if there is caffeine in your drinks *your blood sugars can spike and drop making you hyper and tired
L-I,i think what would happen is it could would dmage your teeth and youcould get diabetes like erica said you may not be able to survive it may be like drinking saltwater instead of regular water you can't survive if you just drink saltwater
L-I,africa's water dries up more quickly because they are closer to the equator
L-I,yes thatsn right but some of the gose to the trees and dose not dry up and it stays under ground
L-I,my theory is that soda is way unhealither than water soda has sugar and other unhealther products water has just water is there any other differences
L-I,i know that one diffrense is that sugar drinks have stuff likecornsyrupnatral flavorslots of sugarlots of lactose
L-I,1 sugar2 carbonation3 water
L-Q,water is unheathy or does this mean that you get something un heathy with that
L-I,my question is where does water come from my theory is that water comes from earths core the water then goes through the ground and goes to lakes rivers or oceans new infowater onearthcycles from the oceans where it evaporates from the surface into the atmosphere forms clouds falls onto the land as rain travels through wetlands rivers lakes and underground then returns to the ocean â collectively known as the hydrologic cycle
L-I,my theory the water comes from graciers lakes groundwaters swamps and river
L-I,it could i also think that too
L-R,i know that the earth will always have about the same amount of water but we can make water dirty so we can't use it again until we purify it in africa one of the main water sources is lake chad but it has been shrinking here is a link to a picture of lake chads water supply docs google com document d 1_kg6wlpn_uep2yruobxnzlfxpb07kr4bgq4fs8icgcu edit link docs google com document d 1_kg6wlpn_uep2yruobxnzlfxpb07kr4bgq4fs8icgcu edit
L-Q,were does water come from
L-Q,how does water scarcity happen
L-I,water scarcity happens when a place is too hot like africa the water evaporates more often
L-Q,i am wondering why sugar drinks have a taste and water doesn't have one
L-I,my theory is most likely that water doesn't have a lot of flavor like ingredients and soda let's say dr pepper has like a caramel color or like caffiene idk how to spell it so that is how
L-Q,does this mean that water tastes like nothing
L-Q,my wondering is what are some ways humans purify water
L-I,some ways humans purify water are *boiling*iodine*filtration systems*evapration traps
L-I,one way humans purify water is a filtration system another way humans could purify water is boiling the water
L-Q,can you make water i do not think you can
L-Q,whats water made out of
L-Q,how would we find a way to increase our water supply to througout the united states instead of just here in america
L-I,we need water because 75% of the human body is made out of water and also since plants need water and they give us oxygen and we need water to live and we get the oxygen from the plants and we give carbon dioxide back to the plants so basically almost everything need water
L-I,"putting our knowledge together to build on we all need water to servive you should wach the movie ""holes"" it will really help it gives you information about what will happen if you dont drink water and what will happen if you dont eat for a while"
L-I,my theory is that it has to do with chemestrey
L-I,wow you canÂ´t we can clean it but making it is a no you can serch that ongoogle but still
L-Q,how do you make water
L-I,i dont think we can make water we get our water from the rain or ground water and other types of ways these are like the types of ways we get water
L-I,we know how to make water but its really hard and there are lots of complications google it
L-I,would we take the time just to make water when it rains every once in a while and google doesn't know everything
L-I,i didnt say we should do it i said we know but theres lots of complications i ment google it and find a website
L-Q,we have so much water in the ocean whats the point of making water
L-I,again i didnt say that humans should start making water and ocean water has salt in it if we drink too much humans will die thats what some people are trying to figure out how to get salt out of the salt water but your obviously not listening i know google dosnt know everything i said find a website
L-Q,how do you make water can somebody help me
L-Q,why can't we just strain the salt water to purify the water
L-Q,hi this is sienna my wondering is how can we move glaciar water to our home town and other places thank you
L-I,my theory is that if we find a way to filter saltwater it could help humans
L-I,hey timy they already made a filter that can trancfer the salt out of salt water
L-I,putting our knowledge together if there is already something that can get the salt out of salt water than we would not be having this unit
L-I,the reason why is that it is very expensive to desalinate water
L-Q,i need to understand why we can't just boil the salt out of the water and filter it also if the water is moving from the ocean to rivers to lakes and streams where it gets cleaned and drinked then why can't we just take out the salt and clean the ocean water of couse then we would have to see how to get it to people in need but still why can't we just do that stuff to the sea water and just deel with it if it is clean it makes no sense
L-I,my theory we can use ships to get it to poor courtys or bulid pips ouder nith the ocan to carry the water
L-I,i know that 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom also known as h2o so if we combine those i think we might get water
L-Q,i fully agree with you on this topic but i have a question how do the hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms bond
L-I,if we put 2 3 hydrogen and 1 3 oxygen in a container then we might turn out with water if we can get a big chunk of a glacier then we can melt it and give more water to countries in need
L-I,we can not bind the two but i was thinking the same thing about both
L-I,what if we had fiters that can filter the salt out of salt water oh wait we do so why canÂ´t we just take a lot of those filter and put thenm all around the world and then peopl can get fresh water all the time and the fresh water can go to alot of good cause and all those cause are food and health
L-Q,i need to understand that why some people can get to water so fast and other people can't is it because those countries are hotter and water evaporates faster or is it because they don't have the technology that we have here and we have water pipes and other countries don't
L-I,"water scarcity has been happening in the book "" long walk to water"" because in 2008 nyla has to walk the whole morning to get water"
L-Q,why can't salva just make a water filter
L-Q,salva doesn't have the mateirials
L-I,my theory is that we should build filters in big factories and transport water all around the world and check if the filters take out the salt in the water
L-I,one way to get fresh water is to melt glaciers into water i know this because if you melt snow or ice it becomes water
L-Q,what are leaches and how are they getting attached to us what happens when they attach on to us
L-I,putting our knowledge together just think about how much water we actually have in this world compared to the salt water salt water is poisen thats why we sweat salt water and pee salt water this is also why your pee is yellow if its clear then you need to drink water
L-I,i do not think salt water is poisonous but we can not use it also pee and sweat as far as i know are not salt water
L-I,sorry if that was rude
L-I,freshwater is water that humans need to survive
L-Q,i need to understand how can scientist make cars that drive its self but they can't turn saltwater into freshwater
L-Q,can we build filters for your problem
L-I,salva has a journey to his home town to eathiopia at the beggening of the journey he had to walk and than get the honey and than walk some more and than get his uncle to join his journey and than let his uncle to hunt down food and than eat the food and than walk some more and than help fix the boat and than test the boat and than eat some food and than get mosquito bites and than travel on the river
L-I,how do humans impact the water we need theyaffectthe quality of rainwater and ofwaterresources both above and below ground and damage natural systems the causes of freshwater pollution are varied and include industrial wastes sewage runoff from farmland cities and factory effluents and the buildup of sediment

L-I,water is importent to us for many reasons so why are wedestroying it and filling it with garbage my theory is that people don't know where to put it so we dump it in water that we can use for many things but we people think that our garbage is going some place that is ok but we don't know whats actually happening cause we don't get telled we're basically being lied to in the face i think we should do something about that
L-I,pollution in the waterthe main sources of water pollution are discharge of untreated raw sewage from households and factories chemicals dumped from factories human littering in rivers oceans lakes and other bodies of water the great pacific garbage patch is one of the main sources of pollution in the water it is known for its many garbage and plastic every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans there may now be around 5 25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean weighing up to 269 000 tons in developing countries 70 percent of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into waters polluting the usable water supply polluted water can cause serious diseases some of these waterborne diseases are typhoid cholera paratyphoid fever dysentery jaundice amoebiasis and malaria chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health pesticides â can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain each year 1 2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage stormwater and industrial waste are dumped into us water while children make up 10% of the world's population over 40% of the global burden of disease falls on them more than 3 million children under age five die annually from environmental factors âapproximately 40% of the lakes in america are too polluted for fishing aquatic life or swimming â âeach year 1 2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage stormwater and industrial waste are dumped into us water â eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land
L-I,water pollution is the contamination of bodies of water usually caused by humans water pollution happens when contaminants get into the water source
L-I,because we cant servive without water
L-I,there is soething called the water table it is under all the soil its at the way bottem do you know what satured means grab a spunge and dip it in a bowl of water squeez it and all the water will spill out if a drop of rain drops on to the soil or durt the drop of water will evaporate into the air when water squirts out of the soil durt its calld a spring just like in tuck everlasting

L-I,for this experiment at school that i did at class was that we tried to move water from the ground to the table and we kind of had some mistakes the litle plugs kept coming of and we did not get much water in the first test but on second we improved so it shows me that when you first do somting it does not go well but if your trying again you will succeed
L-I,i think in our group we should have put the tube inside the beaker and put tape around it more
L-I,my theory i read a book and it said that if there were no moon there would be no waves is that true and if it was true why
L-Q,if there was no water could you drink juice insted
L-I,the fruit would need water i think it would have water in it and if it has added sugar or sweetner that would need water to so i don't think so plus water is better for you
L-I,no because water does not carry sugar juice carry's a ton of sugar and its not that healthy
L-Q,i wonder how and why do fish breath water
L-I,fish have gills which help them breathe underwater
L-I,i got a great idea if helicopters scooped up water with giant water tanks wouldn't that help people who need water
L-I,the water sikell is so in porentent for us as humens and us with plastic is so bad for evey thing straerrecycling or we are going toregretted most of our water comes from our oceans which are very dirty there is stillnot much left for the animals and it will be very disgusting cuz i was little pieces of plastic
L-Q,my question is that if it rains a lot in the rain forests then why doesn't it rain in the dry area's and also the world should try to focus mainly at trying to get food and water around the world to those in need my theory is that people are mainly focusing on how to advance technology and how to make a new way to do something easier that is already easy that's fine but we need to put most of our time and focus into getting food and water to those in need a better theory is that maybe if kids and younger people have to fetch water how about other people from around the world can make programs and help them and find more water
L-Q,why do people need water
L-I,people need water to hydrate
L-I,the reason why we need water is because we wont be able to servive water is more important than food because food just helps your stomach water keeps you alive and water keeps all the animals and plants alive too
L-Q,i need to understand if you left something in soda for two weeks and if you left that same thing in water for two weeks what would be the difference my theory is that the one left in soda would be damaged while the one in the water would be perfectly fine glensummitspringwater com thegreatspringwatervssodadebatefromglensummitspring link glensummitspringwater com thegreatspringwatervssodadebatefromglensummitspring this link is a article about results of drinking water vs the results of drinking soda
L-I,our test diagram was the 3 way vowel on top and the pipe in the water the first test we got 41 ml and the difficulties we had were keeping the pipe in the water and the 3 way vowel we had trouble working it so we wasted some time what we modified we taped the pipe to the cup so it can stay and taped the cup to the table just in case the water we moved was 101 ml our difficulties were turning the thing on the 3 way vowel fast our controls pulling and turning the thing on the 3 way vowel and the thing that was hard and not fair was you can not touch the other things in enrichment some people went outside to get water they got a bit of water the people inside got more and we had to put it on our heads
L-I,my group put the coffee filters inside the cups and we put the carbin in it and poored the water in it was clean but it was blue next time i would only put a little bit of the carbin and a little bit of the water
L-I,the bule sand like stuff is the fertilizer
L-I,our groups plan was1 white filter2 white filter with activated carbon3 brown filter4 white fiterunfourtunaly our plan took out most of our nitrates wre taken out but our nitrate level was about 50 nitrates so in that case our water was still unsafe to drink
L-I,our groups desigened work we use white fiter then carbon and brown fiter next time we wont pour too much dirt water in the carbon so it wont go on the table
L-I,water is essentially everywhere in our world the average human is composed od between 55 and 60% water so what role does water play in our bodies and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy water is virtually everywhere from soil moisture and ice caps to cells inside our own bodies depending on the factors like location fat index age and sex the average human is between 5560% water at birth babies are even wetter being 75 water they are swimmingly similar to fish but their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday so what role does water play in your bodies and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy the h20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints regulate temperature and to nourish the brain and spinal cord water isnât only in our blood an adultâs brain and heart are almost three quarters full of water thatâs roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana lungs are more closer to an apple at 83% and even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water if we are essentially made of water and surrounded by water why do we still need to drink so much
L-I,in class we had to filter water with a coffee filter and we learned that if you double the coffee filter over it will do better against the dirty water
L-I,to reflect on todays science expirement i know that i should use carbon as the second step instead of the first
L-I,so i think that our 3 part filter was good but we messed up on the actived carbon because we did not put in a filter so the water would just stay there
L-I,when we made the filter we used the w filter a carbon and then b filter when we filterd the water it turned out clear
L-I,when i did the thing which you have to try to turn the dirty water into clean it was kinda hard because my group sometimes fight but we did it but we thought we could use more of the active carbon but that made the water cloudy and dirty it clean before we use all the active carbon
L-I,water is much more healthier than soda i know this because soda has a lot of sugar in it but water doesn't have sugar
L-I,putting our knowledge together soda can also weaken you teeth and bones water is good for you + water can hydrate you
L-I,yesterdayi puriefed water first you do the white filter and then you do the a carbon and after that you do the brown filter that's how you get a really good score
L-I,many people cannot get to water because of water scarcity i think water scarcity is when people can't get water i think that also most people don't know how to get water because they don't have the proper education like how nya didn't know how to get water from under the ground because she did not know
L-I,during the filtering expriement we did i learned that if we add to much a carbon it turns the water all black and cloudy in conclusion don't put a lot of a carbon in the water to filter it
L-I,when we first filtered our water it still had some bule in it from when it was dirty but when i was cleaning up i realised that it looked cealer it had no more color my theory is that filters work better over time
L-I,today we tested how much toxin was in dirty water and there was so much of it i will continue
L-I,"when we did our latest project it was about filtering water unfortunetly our water was gray i think it was becuase of too much air carbon we used it in two of our steps instead of one next time we need less carbon and also switch the steps around filtering water is important because nya's sister got sick from drinking dirty water my theory is that she got sick because there are actually nitrates in dirty water an nitrates aren't good for the human body new information that i want to learn is ""what chemicals are in nitrate and how are they bad for us to drink and how are they made exactly """
L-I,new information i learned was that with my group we saw way to filter wateruseing coffe filters it was so fun because when where doing the project and i saw that we were all having fun in the processe we also saw that we learned from our mistakes we had clear water but we though that it coud be more clean so we added more carbon and the clear water with the left over dirty water but it didn't turn out as planed so thats all i have to tell you about my team project i hope i tought you all something
L-I,in the last chapter ofa long walk to water salva visits schools to talk about the project and to raise money but then it skips two years ahead to 2009 nya looks at a man holding up a poster uncle read it out and now they have clean water as soon as i found out my prediction was that the man was salva and he was doing his project there and i was right but i also found out years ago salva's tribe was in war with nya's i know this becuase nya said that salva had different markings scars on his face also when nya got the clean water she was looking at the clarity of how it was so clear this made me compare it to when we were filtering the water and how it was a little bit more clear after i was also suprised when it was all based on a true story except for some parts this made me compare to when we had a budget of 100 and we needed to buy the materials without spending too much and we had to pump it and filter it and it was very hard but i think it was harder for salva becuase he needed the right materials and they were more expensive
L-I,i know that there is water in the ground it is called ground water if the people in africa drank groundwater would it be bad for them i made this theory by knowing that the ground has dirt would people in africa be drinking dirty water of would it be clean this theory cannot explain how the dirt is filtering the water because the soil has nitrates and the water nya was drinking could have been bad for her because of thr high nitrate levels
L-I,good for salva he did what he wanted he did what was wright for his people
L-I,my class and i finsh the booka long walk to water an it was really good we should really build pipes around places where people cant get water
L-I,the water cycle starts in a lake water evaporates and goes into clouds cloud gets dark nd fall of water and rains on land or lakes water travels through underground water ends up in the lake when land meets a lake
L-I,even if we get ground water we still need to filter it
L-I,how a shadow is made a light nose on a big object
L-I,rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms
L-I,the order of colors in the rainbow goes red orange yellow green blue indigo violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave
L-I,this is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye
L-I,its the same with magenta except blue red nonces off
L-I,its also the same with cyan except blue green light bounces off
L-I,shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow the shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object
L-I,it depends on the time of day for the size of the shadow
L-I,a convex lens also helps focus the light
L-I,it dost focus the light
L-I,if you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water
L-I,wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose
L-I,wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow the blue is absorbed and you cant see it
L-I,other lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow
L-I,a liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth
L-I,light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves
L-I,light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line it was proved by many people a long time ago
L-I,a shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow
L-I,solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on
L-I,you have three eye cones in your eyes to see different couplers like i said before the easy way to se many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green
L-I,glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work
L-I,a shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object to see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red
L-I,this is how a shadow is made a shadow is made when light hits an object
L-I,this is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow
L-I,how we make a rainbow with rain after it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow
L-I,solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy
L-I,my theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves
L-I,my theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light
L-I,the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits
L-I,my understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest
L-I,anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected
L-I,rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops the raindrops acts as prisms
L-I,other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction
L-I,if you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came
L-I,i learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth
L-I,a shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow
L-I,i also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity
L-I,the northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth
L-I,if you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green
L-I,if you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected
L-I,when you see a rainbow you only see half of it a rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see
L-I,if you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black
L-I,fluorescence objects are glow in the dark objects a sea animal that lives under the water is glow in the dark and glow in the dark star stickers and bandages fluorescence objects are made be friction like two rocks rubbing together
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the moon covers the sun long time ago a man predicted that there would be a lunar eclipse and he was right
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the sun covers the moon
L-I,my understanding about shadows is that when light hits you it creates a shadow my theory is that the light hits you and goes around you to make a shadow heres a picture to make it more simple
L-I,also they react like chemiluminescence witch is a process of changing chemic energy into light energy
L-I,solar panels absorb sun light rays and turn them into energy
L-I,to reflect colors the object has to be the same color to reflect the light colorto absorb light color the object has to be not the same color to be absorb
L-I,i think that light travels in straight lines and some other people think that light travels in waves i also think that light is a wave but it travels in straight lines i think light travels in straight lines in two ways
L-I,a rainbows are made by raindrops that act like a prism that make the rainbow
L-I,if you look at a green apple for a long time the green cone gets tired but the red and blue are not tired and together red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite color of green
L-I,most things that glow have some fluorescent paint on them this paint absorbs light and then glows until it has no more light absorbed in it
L-I,a shadow is made when darkness made when light shines on a opaque object
L-I,a liner eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the moon is between the sun and the earth
L-I,a shadow is made when a light source hits an object
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the sun foe between the moon and casts a shadow
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon
L-I,i need to understand why you can get two different kinds of shadows one that is larger than you and one that is smaller than you my theory of what happens is that it appends on the time of day
L-I,what helps things that glow are fluorescence pink and other colors
L-I,if your body wants to see a red rose the red is bounced into your eyes and the other colors are absorbs
L-I,if your body wants to see a yellow green and red is bounced into you eyes and the blue is absorbed
L-I,solar panels takes in light and makes it in to energy
L-I,my understanding shadows starts at the shadow view if a light sours hits a optic nontransparent object which creates a shadow such as a person is standing behind a light sours and a shadow papers behind them
L-I,rain can can be used as prisms thats why theres a rainbow after it rains
L-I,a solar panel absorbs light and uses it as energy
L-I,fireflies produce light from their abdominals because of a chemical reaction caused by lucifer and lucifer this is called photoluminescence
L-I,this is how a glow stick works when you snap a glow stick it makes a little hole and to chemicals collide and then they glow this is called chemiluminescence
L-I,a shadow is made by standing in front of a light source and then the place you block up is where the shadow is made
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the moon passes in between the sun and the earth causing a big shadow
L-I,i thought glow in the dark could only happen with one thine but then i read yasmin note and saw that it happens with three things heat friction and electricity
L-I,in the shadows view i learned the closer the sun is to you the stronger it is
L-I,also i learned that your body blocked the sun and that creates a shadow the sun goes through the ground and makes a shadow for a root
L-I,a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside
L-I,we see a red rose because the primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off
L-I,we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off
L-I,a shadow is the darkness left behind when a light sours shines on a nontransparent object
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the moon blocks the sun light from coming to the earth
L-I,a lunar clips is when the sun blocks the moons light from going to earth
L-I,you can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain rain is what make the rainbow in the sky
L-I,solar panels are panels that use light to make electricity
L-I,all we see is light without light we can not see
L-I,we can see a yellow rose because red blue and green are going to the flower red and green bounce into your eyes but blue absorbs
L-I,you can see a red rose because red bounces of and goes into your eyes blue and green get absorbed
L-I,when you see a red flower the red light bounces off the flower in to our eyes and the green blue gets absorbed
L-I,when you shine a light through a glass prism it ell make a rainbow on the surface it needs to be white light of the colors light wail be to strong and wont split up into the rainbow
L-I,this is how absorbing and reflecting works the colors that make the object will be reflected and the leftover color will be wasted not used
L-I,a shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream the light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark
L-I,a solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun it occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth the moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth
L-I,my theory is that light travels in waves i leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light
L-I,most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light
L-I,a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger
L-I,if light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red
L-I,but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black
L-I,what is absorbing my understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white red green and blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed
L-I,what is reflecting my understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed why i think there reflected is because its not the same color
L-I,this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way
L-I,new information a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what i just told you
L-I,the way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green what happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed
L-I,with a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray
L-I,the northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun the particles are so small you couldn't see them how they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow
L-I,convex mirrors are used in stores they let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle
L-I,all we see is light the way i can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color then the color bounces into your eye three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color
L-I,i just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon the earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon
L-I,this is how rainbows are made with rain the sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow
L-I,i think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly
L-I,if you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface the color red is reflected but the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red
L-I,my understanding about a lunar eclipse is that when the earth is between the sun and the moon the sun casts a shadow over the moon called a lunar eclipse
L-I,my theory's that light travels in a wave line because if you drive behind a bus you'll see heat that looks wave
L-I,shadows a shadow is an inexact reflection of your body that shows on a very sunny day when you are outside you see your shadow when you happen to be outside and you look down at the ground also your shadow touches you wherever you touch the ground
L-I,we see a red rose when there is a flashlight or another light source that will shine on the rose and absorb the green and blue light and reflect the red light into our eyes
L-I,and how we see a yellow rose is that it is the same but the red and green light are reflected and blue is absorbed
L-I,how do you make a rainbow with rain the sky is still wet with raindrops and the sunlight shines through the drops and a rainbow forms in the sky make a rainbow with a prism exactly the same way
L-I,the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis and they are lights in the sky that are mixtures of colors that are seen only in the northern parts of the world and that is why they are called the northern lights
L-I,why are northern lights different colors each gas in earths atmosphere glows with its own color when it becomes charged with electricity oxygen gives off an eerie green glow nitrogen glows red and neon gas turns pink
L-I,i also learned that a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun which makes a large shadow over the earth that is why when your outside and the sun dispersals its just a large shadow
L-I,i also learned that a lunar eclipse is caused when the earth is between the sun and the moon
L-I,also if your looking at a yellow flower the blue light would be absorbed allowing the two other colors to both making yellow would bounce of into your two sensitive cone to those colors
L-I,the northern lights are caused by the sun bombarding the earth with tiny partials of electricity when these partials hit the highest part of the hates atmosphere it electrolysis the air and makes it glow
L-I,to make a rainbow with rain it in voles moisture in the air and since there is moisture in the air the moistness acts like a prism
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the earth is right in between the sun and the moon winch casts a shadow over the moon making the moon total darkness
L-I,solar panels are used for sucking up sunlight and using the sunlight for something such as a solar powered windmill that works by the sunlight getting sucked into a solar panel and the light moves the windmill
L-I,a red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed
L-I,a yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon
L-I,inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy this energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy the process of giving off light is called incandescence
L-I,you have three eye cones in your eyes one is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color
L-I,when we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose
L-I,my understanding of light the colors of light light is made up of many many different colors you cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light white light is transparent so you cant see it
L-I,when it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow
L-I,that is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow
L-I,there are also things called solar panels they are made to catch light the light that they catch is used to make electricity solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected
L-I,a shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent when a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow
L-I,a lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun the sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark
L-I,people make shadows by just standing in the light because light travels in a titrate line or waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object
L-I,shadow my theory is that all the light gets around but it doesn't get past your body so it is dark and the shape of your body
L-I,a solar eclipse it happens when the moon is located between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the sunlight
L-I,solar energy solar panels are dark so they attract heat and the sun is turned into thermal energy in the panels there are little tubes and the water gets warmer the warm water is pumped into a storage tank and it heats the house
L-I,the northern lights are red pink ghostly greens the northern lights happen when the sun bombards earth with particles that are electric when they hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and it glows
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the moon and the sun in which the sun shines on earth and makes a shadow on the moon which makes the moon in total darkness
L-I,if a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower
L-I,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part
L-I,lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth
L-I,transparent means full se through so nontransparent means opaque non see through
L-I,aura borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to france or italy the natives feared them because they thought they were evil things
L-I,photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light fact over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence
L-I,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head
L-I,those are the colors of your eye cones what i mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the secondary colors
L-I,the secondary colors of light are made by mixing the primary colors of light here are the secondary colors of light yellow magenta and cyan here is how their made
L-I,the northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter
L-I,a transparent object is something you can see though like stephanie light can go right though it
L-I,a translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light
L-I,when you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows and the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear
L-I,if you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue violet and indigo
L-I,my understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light
L-I,lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day
L-I,the law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray
L-I,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle
L-I,convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated
L-I,i also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent
L-I,another one of the things i learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time they could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow
L-I,when light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point
L-I,lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world it can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything
L-I,when white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow all the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-I,chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light i used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence
L-I,making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out an example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining
L-I,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle
L-I,a translucent object is not see through that means that you cant look through it but a little light can come through a translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer
L-I,a concave mirror has a sort of cave shape we have mirrors that are flat the mirror that i am talking about is that mirror but pushed in this mirror looks like a bowl when you look into it you see a long shape of yourself
L-I,a convex mirror is the very opposite this mirror is pushed out this mirror looks like a belly as we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down
L-I,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided the light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head
L-I,lasers are very bright and very strong they can go through anything if you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop
L-I,to make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light shine all of the colors in the same spot then you will see white light here is a picture to make it more simple
L-I,light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens whits is called diffused reflection
L-I,to make a rainbow withs prism is simple just get a prism and go outside then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow but sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-I,co lours of light you can make white light by mixing red green and blue primary colors of light light together
L-I,the secondary colors of paint are orange green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other
L-I,there are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes they are red green and blue they are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta
L-I,the gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point that point is the meeting place of the light
L-I,your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness in a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright but at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between
L-I,the angle incidents equals the angle of reflection
L-I,a defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror
L-I,you have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue they are all sensitive to there own colors
L-I,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally
L-I,you have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone the red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light
L-I,we have 3 different eye cones the 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue
L-I,a concave mirror looks like a bowl when light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below
L-I,there is some thing called the law of reflection the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror
L-I,a diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror its when all the light goes in lots of directions
L-I,objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous the sun is luminous as well
L-I,cones are things that respond to colored light there are three kinds of light that cones respond to red blue and green
L-I,light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light a prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-I,there are different names for the colors of light those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light there not just named orally the primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors
L-I,the primary colors are red blue and green the same colors as your eye cones
L-I,a convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave
L-I,a concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite
L-I,a convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you a concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close
L-I,you can add another lens to one of those lenses also a double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light
L-I,there are two kinds of light natural and artificial natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs
L-I,the second thing is fluorescence that is made with friction like when two stones rub together they make fire whits is heat and light that is fluorescence
L-I,news flash if you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed
L-I,and umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source that makes a big shadow that is pretty darker
L-I,a penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source that makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter
L-I,eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down the image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize
L-I,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it all the colors will come out the other side
L-I,an umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra
L-I,shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are
L-I,the rainbow is made up of colored light the colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
L-I,there are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue
L-I,a concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and
L-I,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large
L-I,when colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light
L-I,sundials are a form of telling time you can tell the time by the position of the shadow
L-I,shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in
L-I,a concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused
L-I,a convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking
L-I,all of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light
L-I,a transparent object is clear and lets 100 light pass through
L-I,a translucent object is clear swell but only lets 50 go through
L-I,an opaque object lets 0 through
L-I,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection
L-I,the secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta yellow indigo and purple
L-I,red and blue make magenta
L-I,blue and green make cyan and
L-I,green and red make yellow
L-I,all three primary colors make white
L-I,light and materials the most useful materials to use in experiments about light are lenses and mirrors but first mirrors there are two kinds of mirrors there names are concave and convex
L-I,you cant forget flat mirrors there sort of in the middle flat mirrors are pretty important to
L-I,that law only works for smooth mirrors though
L-I,on bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions that is a called a diffused reflection
L-I,now lenses there are two kinds of lenses concave and convex just like the mirrors they do the same things
L-I,lenses are transparent
L-I,there are two other forms that translucent and opaque
L-I,a transparent object means see through
L-I,a translucent object colors the light and
L-I,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely
L-I,now artificial light first chemiluminescence chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light
L-I,then there are lasers lasers are extremely bright and very strong they can go through anything
L-I,there are two different ways you can play with shadows one is an umbra and the other is a penumbra
L-I,those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things those things are eclipses there are two eclipses that we know of solar and lunar
L-I,3 is it true that we cant see without light of course not
L-I,the colors of light i think are in the rainbow winch are redorangeyellowgreenblueindigoand violet
L-I,the primary colors of light are red green and blue
L-I,the primary colors of pigment paint are bluebeard yellow
L-I,there are 2 rinds of light natural and artificial the kind of light that is in your home is artificial if all the windows are covers
L-I,photoluminescence is light made by animals such as fireflies and the tiny fish that live at the bottom of the sea winch my mom loves
L-I,the aurora borealis is very bucketful it is light that hits the sky probably threw water that is why it looks waive
L-I,fl you want to make white light you mix red blue and green together and you have white light
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the earth is in front of the moon
L-I,a solar eclipse is when the moon goes in front of the earth
L-I,a concave mirror is a mirror that is bent in
L-I,a convex mirror is a mirror that is bent out
L-I,photoluminescence is made by animals whose habits don't have much light
L-I,misalliance is made by semicircles
L-I,transparent objects are objects that you see threw
L-I,translucent is when only some light can shine threw
L-I,concave mirrors reflect light out and convex mirrors footrace the light
L-I,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is the light goes onto the mirror and bounces in the isopleth direction
L-I,the law of diffuse refection is the light goes to the mirror and bounces in the same detection
L-I,concave lenses and light rays help near sited people see far sited and
L-I,convex mirrors help far sited people see near sited
L-I,solar powered things are made with solar panels
L-I,lasers are a toolbox they melt mettle
L-I,an penumbra is a shadow shining around the shadow
L-I,an umbra is a dark shadow that comes from a small light
L-I,an opaque is an nontransparent thing
L-I,chemiluminescence is produced by a chemical reaction
L-I,luminescence is made by living things
L-I,lasers are very bright and intense and can burn through anything

L-I,the secondary councilors of light are cyan yellow and magenta
L-I,wen you mix all the primary colors of light together you see white light
L-I,eye cones are in are eyes and some are sensitive to red blue and green and if the red con is not working then you cant see any thing to do with red or red

L-I,an translucent object is a object or material that you can see the couplers through it but you cant see crustal clear like rice paper
L-I,an opaque object is a object is an object that you cant see through like metal opaque objects are uselessly the strongest material
L-I,a convex lens is a lens that consent rats the light beam so when you look at the sore it will be a dot
L-I,thats the ope sit of a concave lens it makes the light sored out you so if your flash light wont sored out then you can holed up a concave lens to the sore of light and it will sored out and cover a larger area but with less power
L-I,the angle of incidents equals the angle of reflection that mens if you shine a light sore on a flare mirror then the angle you shewn the light on the mirror is the angle it will reflect
L-I,if you shin a light on a crumpled up puce of tin fowl then the light will be every where thats called defuse reflection

L-I,an umbra is the dark shadow
L-I,a penumbra is the light shadow
L-I,water bends light
L-I,most lenses focuses light so if a weak but large source of light is being produced and you put a lens under it then it will make the weak light focus and become strong
L-I,some lenses make light spread out
L-I,there are many types of lenses there are glasses magnifying glasses and many many more
L-I,there are primary colors and secondary colors the primary colors of light are red blue and green

L-I,and red and blue make magenta
L-I,and all three make white
L-I,and the secondary colors are magenta cyan and yellow
L-I,rainbows are light colors you can see
L-I,you make a rainbow with a prism if you put a source of light in front of a glass prism you usably don't see a perfect rainbow mane not even a rainbow but sometimes you can see a small rainbow
L-I,but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when i did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights i didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow
L-I,when light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror
L-I,if you use it with aluminum foil thats all crumpled up then light will go out at all sides this is called a diffuse reflection
L-I,there are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror
L-I,but there are two more basic ones one is the concave mirror this mirror looks like a cave it goes in and bounces light inside it
L-I,unlike convex mirrors convex mirrors can bounce off many sides those are the basic mirrors
L-I,if a shiny thing like tin foil is there but bent the law of reflection doesn't work the light goes all over the place
L-I,convex mirrors make your vision all you can see in the area bigger so if you look in a convex mirror you will see a lot more behind you thees are used in places like cars
L-I,there are two types of eclipses the rift one is called a solar eclipse its when the moon goes in front of the earth and behind the sun which casts a shadow upon earth as i said before an opaque object like the moon and the sun is the light source it makes a shadow
L-I,your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but i have had light near and it was dark because i was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think i have benn there long enough but with no light i don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room
L-I,opaque transparent and translucent are some terms in light opaque means that its non see through

L-I,yellow is made by mixing green and red
L-I,magenta is made by blue and red
L-I,and cyan is made by blue and green
L-I,this is how we see white we mix red blue and green all together make white
L-I,this is how we see a yellow rose the white light hits the rose green and red are reflected and blue is absorbed why green and red are reflected incited of just one color is because yellow is a secondary color and are brain sees the rose upside down and backwards
L-I,an opaque object is something that you cant see though at all like a base ball or a baseball bat
L-I,a concave mirror is a mirror that has cave the image looks like your head is bent

L-I,but the primary colors of pigment are yellow blue and red
L-I,blue and green makes cyan
L-I,red and blue makes magenta
L-I,and red and green makes yellow
L-I,of course if you were in pigment yellow would be green
L-I,every person has eye cones that are sensitive to a servant color each eye con is sensitive to either red blue or green
L-I,try clewing one eye then switching one eye looks more red the other more blue since we don't have a third eye we see blue and red and not green because in pigment its replaced with yellow

L-I,diffused reflection is when a ray of light comes and hits something like bumpy tinfoil the light comes and egos everywhere because it has more than one thing to bounce off of it it egos up down right left because when its bumpy it goes like that because of different bumps
L-I,opaque is a thing that you can see and see through but its fuzzy an opaque object is like plastic
L-I,a concave mirror when light is shown into it reflects the light all around and then up
L-I,solar panels can make lots of things do stuff
L-I,translucent object let some light but not all light through so translucent would be like frosted glass or clouds
L-I,an umbra is a small light source that makes a dark shadow
L-I,also the farther you walk away the longer your shadow will get
L-I,when light hits a double concave lens unlike the double convex the light will go further apart
L-I,i learned that a magnifying glass can focus the light more than it can when the light is just by itself
L-I,another thing i learned was that 70 of the worlds sea fish use photoluminescence to make themselves glow
L-I,photoluminescence is when a animal gives of its own light
L-I,fluorescence is when something gives of light while receiving it from somewhere else

L-I,and a convex mirror is pushed out
L-I,some television screens in the 50s were convex screens
L-I,if light comes in on a 45 degree angle on a flat mirror it will come out on a 45 degree angle
L-I,on the other hand if light goes in on a 45 degree angle on a bumpy mirror it will come out all crazy
L-I,here is how solar panels work dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light the dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy the thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan that means that black attracts heat
L-I,the colors of light is the rainbow
L-I,this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light the glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall when you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us these 2 things are all plugd into a wall
L-I,the picture i drew was making a rainbow out of a prism this picture is with two prisms this is how it works if you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again this is how to make white light through a viable spectrum
L-I,the primary colors are red green and blue
L-I,diffused reflection is when a light goad to wards a bumpy mirror and bounces in all directions

L-I,and the penumbra is the lighter part of a shadow
L-I,a lunar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon
L-I,and a solar eclipse is just the reverse of a lunar eclipse
L-I,and red and blue makes magenta
L-I,and finally green and blue make cyan a shade of blue
L-I,also you can see a green object because white light shines on that object white light has red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet in it and the object absorbs all the colors except green which is reflected into the eyes of the person that is looking at the object
L-I,the secondary colors of light are the colors that the primary colors make when mixing each other
L-I,transparent means see through transparent objects are ice and water examples
L-I,translucent means a little light can pass through like tracing paper and wax paper
L-I,opaque means no light can pass through all other objects are opaque and there are a lot of opaque objects in the world
L-I,diffuse reflection is when light bounces off of a bumpy mirror or a piece of crumpled aluminum foil and goes in all directions
L-I,the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the incident ray goes on the mirror and makes the angle of incidence there is an invisible line between the angle and ray of incidence and the angle and ray of reflection the reflection ray is the reflection of the incident ray
L-I,the light rays from a concave lens go outwards like a v shape sort of
L-I,photoluminescence means that a living thing gives off its own light a firefly is an exemplar of a electroluminescent living thing

L-I,you get magenta when you mix red with blue
L-I,those three colors are the three secondary colors of light
L-I,you get white when you mix all three primary colors of light
L-I,the northern lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky they occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity too small for us to see when these particles hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and make it glow
L-I,if colored light shines on a red pence case all the colors get absorbed but red red gets reflected
L-I,if colored light shines on a blue ruler all the colors get absorbed but blue blue gets reflected
L-I,if colored light shines on a black object all the colors of light get absorbed
L-I,if colored light shines on a white object all the colors of light get reflected
L-I,my theory's that light travels in waves because when we did an experiment with progesterone and a tennis ball hanging from the vealing on a piece of string and when we shone light on it the tennis balls shader was clear but the strings shadow had some light on it
L-I,transparent objects are things that light can go through freely through glass and clear plastic
L-I,translucent objects are things that light can go through a bit like paper
L-I,opaque things are things that light cant go through things and produces a shadow opaque things are humans buildings and lots more
L-I,a convex mirror is shaped like richard massing belly
L-I,a concave mirror is shaped like a caves entrance
L-I,dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light so they are perfect for solar panels instead they absorb the suns rays and turn them into thermal energy this means that on a roof there are dark hoses of water the water heats up because the hoses are absorbing the suns rays and they are isolated the heated water is pumped into a storage tank where it used to heat the house
L-I,lasers are very highly bright and intense light it can burn through anything
L-I,photoluminescence are living things that gives off its own light
L-I,chemiluminescence is perused by chemical reactions
L-I,a unbar is a dark shadow
L-I,a penumbra is a light shadow
L-I,when a small light hits an nontransparent object it makes an umbra
L-I,when a larger light hits the same nontransparent object it makes an larger shadow then before and that is called an penumbra
L-I,when two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball one shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object
L-I,an opaque object is an nontransparent object but in an scientific way
L-I,i also understand that the shadow is always on the parasite side of the light source
L-I,the closer you are to the light source the bigger your shadow is
L-I,there are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only there is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was christian huygens the other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines and there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves
L-I,i all so know that when light goes in to a different medium it bends more like air and water those are different mediums
L-I,a laser is a really hot berm of light and it can burn mete
L-I,chemiluminescence is a chemical that makes light
L-I,photoluminescence is a animal that makes its on light
L-I,the secondary colors are cyan yellow and magenta
L-I,northern lights are colored lights in the ski
L-I,if you want to make a rainbow there are two ways to so you could either shine light on water or on a prism it will work either way
L-I,transparent is something that you can see through
L-I,translucent is something that you can sort of see through
L-I,opaque is something that you can not see through
L-I,a concave mirrors a cave shape mirror
L-I,a convex mirror is like a tummy
L-I,the law of reflection is the angle of incident equals the angle of reflection
L-I,diffuse reflection means when light hits busby service light moves all over the place
L-I,when light hits a convex lens it focuses the light and then speeds the light
L-I,a concave mirror takes in light and dress it out
L-I,the next view is the co lours of light view with rainbows a rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow you can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-I,the primary colors of light are bluebeard green
L-I,the primary colors can be made into the secondary colors
L-I,the secondary colors are reacknowledgment
L-I,and agreeableness
L-I,and bluejacket
L-I,and the secondary colors all mixed into one makes white light
L-I,all we see now to the all we see is light view a myriad of notes agree on that you can only see with light
L-I,photoluminescence is light created by animal
L-I,to make white light you need to mix all the primary colors together
L-I,to make a rainbow with a prism you need to shine light through a prism and it makes a rainbow
L-I,there is a thing called a color wheel
L-I,there are cones in your eye they are sensitive to colored light
L-I,if you stare at a picture of a green frog for 10 seconds then stare at a blank sheet of paper you will see a red frog
L-I,when looking at a red rose you need light right you do so when your looking at that objetc the light shines on it and since it is red it refletcs the red light off the objetc and all the other colors get absorbed its the same with any other color including yellow green etc
L-I,there are three different types of materials opaque translucent and transparent
L-I,opaque means nothing can pass through it
L-I,translucent means that it is see through but is colored
L-I,transparent means it is completely see through
L-I,a concave mirror focuses the light inward
L-I,a convex mirror focuses the light outward

L-I,a penumbra is a light shadow caused by a big light source
L-I,our class has many theories about how light travels we have 5 theories 1 ripple 2 wave 3 wave in tube 4 particle 5 straight
L-I,there are 3 different theories about how light effects how we see the two theories are your eyes can adjust to light they cant and you see only the outlines
L-I,my understanding of light in natural and artificial light even though i am a master of that view i know that stars are made of gas not fire i found that interesting because before i read those notes i thought that stars were made of fire and only planets were surrounded by gas
L-I,i also learned lasers can cut through absolutely anything even diamonds
L-I,also i learned that 70 percent of the underwater animals use photoluminescence i also found this interesting fungi and bacteria use photoluminescence
L-I,a umbra is the darker part of the light that you may shine anywhere you see the umbra when the light hits something
L-I,the penumbra is a lot like the umbra but is the lighter part
L-I,in light and materials i know that a transparent object is see through
L-I,a translucent object is sort of see through
L-I,and opaque is non see through
L-I,you can see more in a convex mirror than a concave mirror
L-I,the law of reflection is when the indecent ray hits the flat mirror the reflection ray bounces back
L-I,a diffuse reflection is when light hits a something bumpy and the light goes everywhere
L-I,in co lours of light it talks about the primary colors of light are red blue and green
L-I,and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and cyan
L-I,if you mix the primary colors of light you get white light
L-I,if you shine light through a prism it makes a rainbow
L-I,the northern lights are usually found up north people used to be scared of them
L-I,there are two types of shadows the umbra and the penumbra
L-I,the umbra is a small and dark shadow you will get when you use a small light sours
L-I,the penumbra is a lighter shadow around the umbra you get the penumbra when you use a large light
L-I,you can use shadow to tell time with a sundial
L-I,and the primary colors of paint are red yellow and blue
L-I,the secondary colors of light are yellow cyan and magenta
L-I,the secondary colors of paint are purple orange and green
L-I,you can make white light by mixing red blue and green
L-I,light can be reflected and absorbed
L-I,the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis the aurora borealis is light there are lots of colors in the aurora borealis
L-I,there are 3 ways to describe an object the 3 ways are transparent translucent and opaque
L-I,a transparent object is like glass you can see through it
L-I,a translucent object is an object that is ike sand falling through water light can go through it
L-I,an opaque object is like peter light cant go through him
L-I,a convex mirror looks like the picture above on the right
L-I,a convex lens focuses the light
L-I,a concave lens speeds out the light
L-I,there are 4 come types of luminescences photoluminescence chemiluminescence electro luminescence and thermoluminescence
L-I,things that glow are called fluorescence
L-I,gazers are very strong and used for a lot of things
L-I,my theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line
L-I,shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object if the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror if there is no light there isn't a shadow so there is a shadow where the light cant reach
L-I,the sun is the most important light source
L-I,objects that don't give off light are non luminous
L-I,a flashlight is luminous when on but is non luminous when switched off
L-I,when an animal gives off its own light its called photoluminescence as in biomasses
L-I,chemiluminescence is produced by certain chemical reactions for example glow sticks
L-I,electro luminescence is produced by electric discharges for example when silk or fur is stroked or when adhesive surfaces are separated
L-I,thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks one of these sources is wintergreen life savers if you are chewing one turn the lights of look in a mirror while chewing look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks
L-I,a rainbow is made up of seven different colors red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-I,it is made when raindrops fall on something like a leaf and the sunshine shines through the leaf and the raindrop acts like a prism
L-I,the primary colors of light are blue green and red
L-I,and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and sin
L-I,yellow is made when mixing green and red
L-I,magenta is made when mixing red and blue
L-I,and sin is made when mixing green and blue
L-I,when we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow
L-I,when we had the class debate i was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves and now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight that means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves it depends on how you look at it or what your experiment is trying to prove in our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines thomas young experiment
L-I,the way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color the green light keeps going until it goes into your eye then the brain identifies what color and it is
L-I,cones tire easily if you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired so when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel
L-I,this is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order as you know there are seven colors that we know of they all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed but when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed for some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest
L-I,a thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights this happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun the sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic the earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow the colors that glow are red pink and green
L-I,they also have something called the law of reflection the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection to clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle
L-I,but first natural light there are two sections that i am going to write about first photoluminescence photoluminescence is made from a living thing like electric sale they make their own light therefore electric sale are electroluminescent so are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi
L-I,1 is it true that all we see is light my theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes
L-I,2 how do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque opaque light bounces off it into your eyes
L-I,transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly
L-I,translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects
L-I,1 how do you think light travels my theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going my theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines like a flashlight that also explains why light is hot
L-I,reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off and blue light hit it it would absorb
L-I,if you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow
L-I,how we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down the solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around
L-I,we did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows first we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows
L-I,how do out make a rainbow with a prism the white light goes in to the prism and it splits the light up into 7 different color s and those different colors are the colors of them rainbow
L-I,how you make a rainbow with rain rain acts likes prisms and do the same thing that prisms do
L-I,how you see a yellow rose red and green are reflected and all the other colors were absorbed
L-I,water refracting light is when light goes in the water after light is in air the light is bent by the water
L-I,an eclipse course when the earth or the moon blocks the suns light
L-I,a solar eclipse happens when the moon is between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the suns light
L-I,a shadow is when light is shewn on a opaque object and the shadow is what is behind the opaque object
L-I,light travels in all directions i need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else my theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight
L-I,all we see is light
L-I,if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed
L-I,we belove that a rain drop can make a rainbow 1 1382
