a better theory is like how an ants or whatever are working or somthing couse you can wach videos#L-E
my theory do you know energy carries all the time right now energy is being carried from a plant to little animal to big animal back to little animal to soil and it repeats agian and again#L-E
my theory i think worker ants do most of the work the worker ants would be building the ant hill i agree that the ant hills would be made out of dirt too#L-E
my theory if ants build ant houses and they carrie the grains of sand won't they fall of#L-E
my theory if you need any ideas dont water the ants ants could die if waters hits ants build just a few ant hills because thousands of ants live in one ant hill#L-E
my theory is i think if you wanna see if it is a living it has to grow somthing and need water to live new information a non living thing does not need water to survive#L-E
my theory is if a venomous or poisonous animal eats another venomous or poisonous animal some will survive and some will maybe die some animals eat venomous or poisonous animal as a food sourse but maybe another animal can't survive it#L-E
my theory is if you crush a seed and give it water soil and sun it will grow#L-E
my theory is it flips over#L-E
my theory is many apples rot because the weather is changing#L-E
my theory is maybe that the male might become king of the ants#L-E
my theory is over time i think that the stem of the apple gets weaker and weaker and sometimes the wind might blow the apple off the tree and probably some animals nock them off too#L-E
my theory is that a bird or animal flys over and drops it into the courtyard and then lays eggs that make more spider which make more and more and more until they go exsticked or the eco system dies#L-E
my theory is that air works to clean up are ecostyem by blowing dead leaves away or to barry it#L-E
"my theory is that an anthill is prepared by worker ants that are strong like not ants that are just born a better theory is that the queen ant could get a part of a different colony who the queen says in ant language could say ""build me an anthill """#L-E
my theory is that animanles clime under ground to the court yard and eat bugs and frogs other animales to how do all those other animanles#L-E
my theory is that birds carry them over#L-E
my theory is that i usually see moss on the dark areas of trees so i am thinking it forms on dark areas i also think it forms when its dewy and wet#L-E
my theory is that if a predetor is close it will turn over to blend in#L-E
my theory is that if moss dies out then it will create a problem wave in the ecosydom many animals will die and plants will to because it provides water on those hot days when there is no water#L-E
my theory is that it will still live but it cant do thing as fast it will walk way slower and it may die because it cant get to food on time#L-E
my theory is that jaguars don't really eat chimpanzees and that people from africa don't kill and eat jaguars but i think that chimpanzees might eat ants good work overall#L-E
my theory is that mabye 2 grass hoppers went arcross the top of the building and had a lot of kids grass hoppers and thats how this theory cannot explain how the grass hoppers made it across#L-E
my theory is that maybe plantsmake food the roots also need air so they can get nutrients and plants need air they use the carbon dioxide in the air for water because there is 1% of water in air it is called photosynthesis some info from google#L-E
new information all ants have different jobs as they grow they get darker ants go faster since they have tiny legs there can be a thousands of ants in a anthill if a ant get feed the right things they can be a queen#L-E
new information almost every ecosystem needs soil for their environment soil is a massive help towards growing plants and being homes towards many insects without soil plants wouldn't grow and the food web would go wack without all the producers plants#L-E
new information almost every ecosystem needs water to grow its enviornment and its whole species every animal needs water plants need it in order to grow too without plants in the food chain it would go wack making a species over populated and then go extinct#L-E
new information i learned is that abiotic means decomposition by a chemical process and that biotic means decomposition of living orgonisms#L-E
new information peat is formed by decaying moss and plants this is important because peat is a fuel it can be used for fertilizer burn for fuel and eventually it becomes coal#L-E
new information the sun provides humankind with light and heat to create new earth habitate it also provides plants to grow to help the food chain sunlight also helps with weather which weather helps ecosystems too sunlight can cause droughts when there is less rain and intense rain#L-E
new information you can tell how old a tree is if you cut it open a bit you see circles 1 circle for every year#L-E
new information when ants die the other ants leave it alone but after two days they carry it to the ant graveyard they do this because after two days it starts to smell which gives signals to the ants that it is dead#L-E
blockquote i learned that the food chain is what connects animals my theory is that the food chain is in regions because pandas are only in asia so something in antarica can't eat it a better theory i have is that somehing in both places can connect them mabey something that live in one place gets eaten by something tat lives there and in another place and that animal gets eaten by anther animal blockquote#L-E
a plant can grow without real sunlight but if you dont have real sunlight it has to grow withartificial sunlight lamp light night light but a plant can not grow without sunlight#L-E
a species is a group of organisms that are so alike they classify as a group to be a type of species the organisms have to be able to reproduce for example a mule is not a species because it is not able to reproduce#L-E
air+water+sunlight=wind water makes clouds and if you add too much wind you'll make a thunderstorm or atornado#L-E
all moss needs to havespores to live causethat is how water and air gets into the mossor the plant#L-E
all plants usesunlightto make food sugars in a process called photosynthesis#L-E
another reason why living things need energy is because if you donÂ´t eat you can starve and cannot live#L-E
ants are super strong so they dig the hole quiqly even after it gets destroyed#L-E
apples fall off the trees in winter because they get weak#L-E
atoms are small particles building blocks that are everywhere they are made up of a central dense nucleus which is surrounded by one or some more lightweight negativity charged particles that are called electrons#L-E
carbon is everything without carbon there would be no universe#L-E
decomposersbreak down the remains of dead plants and animals and in doing so releasecarbon dioxidethrough respiration#L-E
energy can come from the sun and fossil fules and the suns energy is the main source of life like the plants convert it into food for them and then an anamail comes along and eats the plant and absobs the energy#L-E
first apple trees need sun light to grow and the rain then it keeps growing and growing untill it becomes a big apple tree with tasty apples on it#L-E
flamingos are born gray but they eat a type of plant and a type of mineral in the plant turns the flamigo pink it should be the same with ants#L-E
i agree with varsha becasue i onlny see moss on tree bark and the ground dirt#L-E
i agree with you because trees and plants can not live with out chlorophyll#L-E
i also think that the moss grows to the north because the north is colder and moss usually grows in cool and wet conditions#L-E
i also think that the moss is effected by the tree position#L-E
i can add on to that beacuse when the weather is putting the pressure on to the apple and making it fall off the tree its like when someone were to push you off the edge of a pool the pressure of the person pushing you is putting impact on your boby and therefore making you fall into the pool also i agree with you saying that if a person were sick its like an apple slowly rotting because it dosn't have the nutrients to grow off of#L-E
i can add on to that because when weather puts the pressure on the matter it can make it transfer into a different shape or fall apart like if there was a tsunami the waves are so strong that they can make houses and buildings fall apart and it can squish cars and make them flat or put them into a different shape or like when you pour water into a cup it takes the form of the cup#L-E
i dissigry they carry sand one by one i think#L-E
i don't think plants have energy i think they have nurtrients that turns in to fuel energy for the thing thats eats them#L-E
i don't think the moss will die out because when moss dies it will become rich soil for new mosses and plants to grow#L-E
i dont think metal ever lived#L-E
i dont think so because what if a bee died in it#L-E
i learned tha there are over 12 000 types of ants also they are soical insects witch mean they move in larage groups#L-E
i noticed that maybe only some trees have moss growing to the north maybe like a compass moss will grow to the north because there is something there what is that something#L-E
i predict that the moss on the ground will keep growing if it gets water and sun or else it will die my theory is that the cold weather and the rain will keep it alive or the rain will sit there and the cold will freeze it#L-E
i think once the ivy interacts with the skin it will infect the outside layer of skin and the interaction will cause an infection from bolth the ivy and the skin and that will create the rash#L-E
i think that the weather is making the apples fall down beacause the wind is putting preser on the apple my theory is that when the apples fall down they rot because they don't get the nuterents they need i need to understand that the applesare like people if the don't get there nutrents they get sick#L-E
i think that there is nutrients in thing animals eat that give them energy if they can't get energy they might be a canirvor if it's a plant because they can't convert those nutrients#L-E
i think you miss understand what spores are spores are kind of like the seeds for moss exept thereÂ´re microscphic#L-E
i think your 2 answer is correct and that it is probably a different type of moss#L-E
if a feamle ants eat the right food they turn into queen ants#L-E
if an ant eats the right kind of food it can become a queen ant#L-E
in photosynethesis the plant will use energy from the sunlight to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into simple sugars a plant needs water and sunlight for food#L-E
in the daytime the hot air comes from the river and than it goes up in the air and than the cold air replaces it in the courtyard when its about to be winter the nights are cold but in the summer the nights are worm by the ways the air cycle in the daytie is the opposite of the air cycle in the nightime#L-E
is that the green side might be for camofloging with the leef and brown side for sand#L-E
it interacts with humans because if it is contagous than it can spred around if you tuch it#L-E
it probably grew like that over time maybe something happened to it#L-E
leaves absorbe the sun light and water and creates the suger that it uses to live#L-E
maybe a cherry tree or some type of trees full of fruits#L-E
maybe small animals like ants for a nest or a birdwhen the moss is on the tree the bird might use it for it's nest#L-E
maybe the ant that eats the right food will not be the king because it dosen't lay babies but it can lead the other ants to find another group with a queen#L-E
maybe there is somethingattracting the moss so it goes north#L-E
mosquioes are the most different creature on the planet because its one of the only living creature carry diseases#L-E
moss only grows on the northern side of tress if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere the moss grows on the southern side of trees#L-E
moss will grow better in damper places because it takes in all the water in the air#L-E
most animals need water to survive water allows metabolism occur which is the process that drives all the biochemical reaction that take places in cells#L-E
most likely it would not grow just because that the roots are whatstartthe process for the tree to grow my theory mostly is that the tree will not grow anymore but will still live unless you cut it or it falls#L-E
my theory is you can feel the sun on you even if itÅ far away because the rays give off a whole lot of energy the sun reflects on a cloud and a cloud shoots to the ground like a mirror#L-E
my theroy is that white soil interacts with the plants the same as brown regular does because i have observed no change between either white soil or regular brown soil my hypothisis is that they are just diffrent colors and i do not think that that change makes a diffrence of how they grow#L-E
no because metal is not madde out of anything living#L-E
noah another term is apex prdetor wich means top of the food web#L-E
out side in the courtyard i found a brick wih a small patch of moss in the middle of the brick touching no other patches of moss i need to understand how the moss lives this theory cannot explain because i have not gatherd enough informaition#L-E
photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to create foods from carbon dioxide and water#L-E
photosynthesis is the process used by plants algae and certain bacteria to harness energy from sunlight and turn it into chemical energy here we describe the general principles of photosynthesis and highlight how scientists are studying this natural process to help develop clean fuels and sources of renewable energy#L-E
poison in poison ivy poison oak and poison sumac is called urushiol and it is used to protect the plant never burn the plant because if the urushiol gets in the air and you breathe it in it will most likely kill you#L-E
rhizoids are the super thin roots that hold the moss in place they arenÂ´t very strong so you could pick it up without struggle#L-E
serena an egg is clear then it turns white when it is older then the baby is clear and gets its colors when it's oldercamryn a baby is clear till it gets older than they turn a dark brown#L-E
some caterpillars like monarchs eat milkweed leaves so that they can scare there predators off and so they dont get eaten#L-E
some flowers are very sweetsmelling and they originally grew thorns to protect themselves from animals that may try to eat them so my theory is that they they may have been for protection like you said#L-E
spiders eat insects and get eaten by birds and fish so spiders are first level predators but not apex predators#L-E
spores are carried by the wind then it grows into moss#L-E
"the apple rots because the enrgery from the tree put it into the apple when it was on the tree and when said apple fell off of the tree it didn't get any more ""food"" from the tree so it will rot and die then posibly get eaten"#L-E
the bettle has a brown side for camiflouge and the green side is for that if camiflouge fails it can turn around to show the brigh green side to try to scare away the preadator#L-E
the energy is still being produced because if it stoped the tree would die the leaves are probably are getting weak and dry because the cold#L-E
the female moquitos spit on your skin to num up your skin were it smells looks sweeet and suger filled and then they put their sharp nose in your skin and find a blood vesel and suck out your blood#L-E
the freezing and cold tempretures will kill the moss and the rain will help it grow#L-E
the plant also useswater from rain and carbon for the process to work for the gluocose like a cooking recipe#L-E
there are diffrent types of moss such asiron moss wich will only grow on thigs with heavy amounts of iron on it my theory is that the moss only sticks to certain things your friend sienna#L-E
there can be a lot of different animals new information insects are anials too if insect are animals there is so many types of animals like grass hoppers ants mousqutioand other different insects#L-E
they give plants energy and animals eat that plant so they get energy and so on#L-E
they need sugar so they could make fruits and my question is how do the plants make sugarphoto=light and synthesis=putting toghetherleaves have tiny pores called stomata so carbon dioxide can enter the plant#L-E
toads can burrow if there is a predotor or a emergency maybe thats where toads go when its winter under ground#L-E
when do the mosquitos stop drinkings the blood well that's a good question etheir the mosquito's stomach gets full or it gets spotted and flys away quickly or dies because it got swatted by somebody#L-E
when the apple falls from the tree it gets a bruise then the decomposers build o to the bruise and takes the energy from the apple then the apple rots#L-E
when the apples fall they interact with the air because the apple is falling through the air when it falls to the ground it is interacting with leaves over time the apple will interact with decomposers the decomposers interact with the apple by eating it so it get rotten#L-E
when they dig the ants push dirt out to make tunnles witch makes a ant hill like when you dig with a tunnle#L-E
when they fall of the tree than they cant grow any more like a human when a human eats and than grows and you grow till you cant grow any more than advetually die so thats the same with apples#L-E
why are baby ants white when their born and then they turn to their regular ant colony color and not just be born the same color as their ant colony what i did learn though is that when the ants are born they have no legs and can't do anything without the help of the other ant or so called worker ants my theory is if the baby ants are born without legs and can't do anything by itself maybe that has to do with why its color is white also if their decomposers maybe something from that equals to why the baby abts are born white and if they eat te right type of foods they can turn to their regular coloies colors#L-E
yes my theory is yes during oter sesings in winter ther fur might white or oter colers#L-E
"image kf6 rit albany edu manual_assets kf4images iconnoteunreadothr gif"" missing link "" link contribution by missing authors when a tardigrade is dry up it starts to synthesize special molecules which fill the tardigrades cells to replace lost water by forming a matrix a matrix is like a net the marix keeps cells from the tardigrade from moving or combining"#L-E
a better theory i think ant hills are living because the are in are ecosystem and they are ecsposed to air to live#L-E
my theory a daddy long legs fangs are to short to bite people but there tails are have been so deadly with venom#L-E
my theory is that maybe the berries are a source of food to the stink bugs and that's why they were all over the berries#L-E
my theory is that moss lets go clusters of seeds into the air and let the wind carry it away#L-E
my theory is that spiders can climb up walls because they shoot a spider web up and climb it and the web is sticky#L-E
my theory is that the enviormet is good here at this time#L-E
my theory is that the ground hog that we saw might live here in guilderland because there are nutrients maybe here so that is why i am searching wy groundhogs live in guilderland this theory cannot explain why ground hogs live in guilderland#L-E
my theory is that the moss might have got stuck on the brick somehow and there might have some water on it that might keep it sticking if you look in google how it gets stuck on the brick and gets nutrients from it might help#L-E
my theory is that there are all kinds of diffrent cattipilers but there is only one kind that i know that is piosenes and it is white with black spikes and it is really cool iv seen one or two before and thoes are the most dangoures cattipilers that i know#L-E
my theory is that there is oil on the poison ivy that makes you ich and there is alot of diffrent ways it can get in any were at any time at any place#L-E
my theory is that they are poisonis because they eat stuff that makes them poison is#L-E
my theory is that they eat anamals that cant hert them that much#L-E
my theory is that they go down deep so preditors will not eat them#L-E
my theory is that they need food to survive#L-E
my theory is that they need there fur to survive and water food#L-E
my theory is that they still could live because they would still have a lot of their legs and most likely 2 legs would not through them of ballance#L-E
my theory is that weather is a super strong force that uses lots of different matter like wind water houses and more weather can c hh znge a lot of things like people if it always snowed no crops could grow and all living things would die out#L-E
my theory is the apple fell of the tree and the decomposers eat the apple and the apple got less energy and rotted#L-E
my theory is the spider might still live for ages because a spider needs equal legs#L-E
my theory is the thorns are usedto keep plant eating animals away we should work together on this wondering#L-E
my theory is there might have been nutrients on the bery so that must be why#L-E
my theory is they might crall over the school like going on it and crall on to the roof to go in the courtyard#L-E
my theory is apples fall because of gravity the apple falls when it gets ripe once it is ripe it gets weak around the stem and the gravity pulls it down to the ground#L-E
my theory is toads do not go undergrond because they do not go undergrondthey go into a state of hibernation and somecanbe exposed to temperatures below freezing aquatic#L-E
my theory is that the white and black catipiller is piosonous but some one else thinks there is another black and white catipiller in florida but i disagree#L-E
my theory it is probably damp there to because it is dark and that stops the sun from drying it so maybe it grows in dark and damp places#L-E
my theory mosquitos are the most deady creatures in the world they can cary thousands of deiseases#L-E
my theory moss grows on the north side of trees because water evaporates on the north side of the tree in the southern hemisphere water evaporates on the south side of trees#L-E
my theory my theory is that ants find the hills and just put hole and the top the dont build the hills#L-E
my theory of why the stinkbugs are not moving when they are on the berries is maybe they want it as their source of food and the stinkbugs don't want the other stinkbugs getting over the berries also maybe since it's getting colder the stinkbugs want to get as much food as they can because it will be a lot colder and the stinkbugs will lose their sources of food#L-E
my theory poison is used to scare predetors away or else the predotor will dye slowly#L-E
my theory seeds are living matter because seeds in apples are like unborn children they dont grow but when they get the right treatment they grow into a huge apple tree#L-E
my theory that plants don't have energy in them they have nutrients and ogranisoms that eat them that eat plants get the nutrients into energy to move and do other stuff animals that don't don't get the energy#L-E
my theory mosquitos are the most deadly animals in the world they cary thousands of diseases#L-E
my theory moss does not only grow on the north side of trees moss grows on the north side of trees if the tree lives in the northern hemisphere the reason for this because the sun hits the north side of trees so water evaporates so moss grows if the tree lives in the southern hemisphere it grows on the south side#L-E
my theory wonce one gets in it lays eggs whitch makes more and one probibly crawled on the roo#L-E
my theory grasshoppers go through 4 stages of their life cycle egg nymph adult grasshoppers and death a nymph looks like a little adut grasshopper but with out wings#L-E
my theory i think the worms use the slime on their bodies help them to move around in the soil#L-E
my theory is that it's wind#L-E
my theory is that the plant starts to dies when the soil becomes more unheathly or they can't get the minerals that they need#L-E
new information moss seedless spores the wind carriess the spores throw the air and if it is in the right codistion then it will land on ground and it will grow the plant called moss#L-E
anthony female mosquitos are the only mosquitos that drink blood because they need nutrients for their eggs male mosquitos are harmless and instead eat nectar#L-E
i agree with owian but i think that the ants do a few grains of sand dirt at a time#L-E
i agree with serena because the plants made no progress over the weekend so i will also check with serena if the plants made any progress on the 7th of december and\or 10th of december#L-E
i noticed that ants were crawling around sand and there was a ant hole i need to understand how living underground impacts ants and what impacts ants living underground my theory is that snow and rain impacts ants living underground by bringing the ant hole down also does warm weather impact ants living underground also#L-E
i noticed that moss does not have seeds i need to understand that why does moss grow if it does not have seeds so it can grow my theory is moss is growing because a reaction that supposedly it makes moss grow#L-E
i noticed that moss was growing on the trees i need to understand why does moss grow on the tree my theory maybe the weather effects the moss or the light#L-E
i noticed that some plants in the courtyard are rotting i need to understand what causes living plants to interact with the rotting plants my theory is that the rotting plants decay into the soil and the living plants use the soil to grow#L-E
i noticed that the moss was get larger and larger as it spread i need to understand how and why does moss spread to other things around it my theory is that moss spread more cause it grows to the round and evantually reaches other objects#L-E
i noticed that there was more moss on the sides of the boards on the bench then on the top i need to understand if the moss grows better in the shade than in the sun my theory is that the moss needs to be in a dark and moist place this might be why it sometimes grows on wood#L-E
i noticed that when the wind blow the leaves fell off the tree i need to understand why the weather effects living and nonliving matter in the ges ecosytem my theory is thay when the weather puts presure on the matter like hail rain or wind the matter falls flattens or moves like when you get pushed you fall forward#L-E
i noticed the apple tree had some leaves that were green and some were yellow i need to understand why the leaves are different colors i know the temperature is getting cooler does that impact the way the tree changes my theory is that the leaves will eventually get so old they turn colors like my hair is so old it has turned gray#L-E
i think a few years at most#L-E
i think berry trees have red stuff on it#L-E
i think moss forms in dark areas because it grows on dark spot on trees#L-E
i think spiders climb walls by gripping into cracks with their legs#L-E
in other cases there would be making it moss because i just realized that moss cant grow seeds but plants can#L-E
the sun will allways be a mystriye because nobody has even gotten anywhere near the sun without dieing#L-E
well jack you see air you see it everywhere and air s everthing and plus air is the first thing that you see in the morning when you wake up#L-E
my theory is that most water are dirty in villages and if we install filters in villages so they can be clean#L-E
it might be because they don't have the resources#L-E
i think it's because there is not a lot of bodies of water and they have a lot of 3rd world countries that can not afford wells#L-E
some countries don't have the water they need because the dont have the equipment to filter and distribute it to more people#L-E
some countries also don't have much water because of a drout or of a water shortage from a war or hot weather#L-E
maybe we can install underground pipes that go to all of the villages and then the water can go through a filter and be cleaned and ready to drink#L-E
so my theroy is that we could we can put water towers in different areas then we put pipes in#L-E
they should filter the water if its dirty so it's healthy or add pipes around so it's not as hard to get water#L-E
what weill happed if you drink too much water will you be fine#L-E
my theory is that if you drank only sugar drinks for 2 weeks these could be some of the results *you might get diabetes*your teethmight rot and fall out*you might have a hyperactivity seizure*your organs might get weaker because they had too much sugar energy and shorted out *you would gain a lot of weight*you might get dehydrated if there is caffeine in your drinks *your blood sugars can spike and drop making you hyper and tired#L-E
i think what would happen is it could would dmage your teeth and youcould get diabetes like erica said you may not be able to survive it may be like drinking saltwater instead of regular water you can't survive if you just drink saltwater#L-E
africa's water dries up more quickly because they are closer to the equator#L-E
yes thatsn right but some of the gose to the trees and dose not dry up and it stays under ground#L-E
my theory is that soda is way unhealither than water soda has sugar and other unhealther products water has just water is there any other differences#L-E
my theory the water comes from graciers lakes groundwaters swamps and river#L-E
my theory is most likely that water doesn't have a lot of flavor like ingredients and soda let's say dr pepper has like a caramel color or like caffiene idk how to spell it so that is how#L-E
my theory is that it has to do with chemestrey#L-E
i dont think we can make water we get our water from the rain or ground water and other types of ways these are like the types of ways we get water#L-E
we know how to make water but its really hard and there are lots of complications google it#L-E
would we take the time just to make water when it rains every once in a while and google doesn't know everything#L-E
i didnt say we should do it i said we know but theres lots of complications i ment google it and find a website#L-E
again i didnt say that humans should start making water and ocean water has salt in it if we drink too much humans will die thats what some people are trying to figure out how to get salt out of the salt water but your obviously not listening i know google dosnt know everything i said find a website#L-E
my theory is that if we find a way to filter saltwater it could help humans#L-E
hey timy they already made a filter that can trancfer the salt out of salt water#L-E
putting our knowledge together if there is already something that can get the salt out of salt water than we would not be having this unit#L-E
the reason why is that it is very expensive to desalinate water#L-E
my theory we can use ships to get it to poor courtys or bulid pips ouder nith the ocan to carry the water#L-E
i know that 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom also known as h2o so if we combine those i think we might get water#L-E
if we put 2 3 hydrogen and 1 3 oxygen in a container then we might turn out with water if we can get a big chunk of a glacier then we can melt it and give more water to countries in need#L-E
we can not bind the two but i was thinking the same thing about both#L-E
what if we had fiters that can filter the salt out of salt water oh wait we do so why canÂ´t we just take a lot of those filter and put thenm all around the world and then peopl can get fresh water all the time and the fresh water can go to alot of good cause and all those cause are food and health#L-E
my theory is that we should build filters in big factories and transport water all around the world and check if the filters take out the salt in the water#L-E
one way to get fresh water is to melt glaciers into water i know this because if you melt snow or ice it becomes water#L-E
putting our knowledge together just think about how much water we actually have in this world compared to the salt water salt water is poisen thats why we sweat salt water and pee salt water this is also why your pee is yellow if its clear then you need to drink water#L-E
i do not think salt water is poisonous but we can not use it also pee and sweat as far as i know are not salt water#L-E
you can create water but it would be dangrass and we might loose osgyan#L-E
putting our knowledge together i know that people need clean water in order to stay nice and healthy otherwise if people drink dirty water people is going to be sick or pass away#L-E
water is importent to us for many reasons so why are wedestroying it and filling it with garbage my theory is that people don't know where to put it so we dump it in water that we can use for many things but we people think that our garbage is going some place that is ok but we don't know whats actually happening cause we don't get telled we're basically being lied to in the face i think we should do something about that#L-E
water pollution is the contamination of bodies of water usually caused by humans water pollution happens when contaminants get into the water source#L-E
because we cant servive without water#L-E
there is soething called the water table it is under all the soil its at the way bottem do you know what satured means grab a spunge and dip it in a bowl of water squeez it and all the water will spill out if a drop of rain drops on to the soil or durt the drop of water will evaporate into the air when water squirts out of the soil durt its calld a spring just like in tuck everlasting#L-E
my theory is that water is way heather than soda a better theory is soda has a lot of calerles and water is way beter than soda and milk is better than#L-E
my theory i read a book and it said that if there were no moon there would be no waves is that true and if it was true why#L-E
the fruit would need water i think it would have water in it and if it has added sugar or sweetner that would need water to so i don't think so plus water is better for you#L-E
no because water does not carry sugar juice carry's a ton of sugar and its not that healthy#L-E
i got a great idea if helicopters scooped up water with giant water tanks wouldn't that help people who need water#L-E
people need water to hydrate#L-E
the reason why we need water is because we wont be able to servive water is more important than food because food just helps your stomach water keeps you alive and water keeps all the animals and plants alive too#L-E
water is much more healthier than soda i know this because soda has a lot of sugar in it but water doesn't have sugar#L-E
putting our knowledge together soda can also weaken you teeth and bones water is good for you + water can hydrate you#L-E
many people cannot get to water because of water scarcity i think water scarcity is when people can't get water i think that also most people don't know how to get water because they don't have the proper education like how nya didn't know how to get water from under the ground because she did not know#L-E
even if we get ground water we still need to filter it#L-E
how a shadow is made a light nose on a big object#L-E
rainbows are when light goes through rain droplets that act like prisms#L-E
the order of colors in the rainbow goes red orange yellow green blue indigo violet its in that order because of the light waves red is the longest light wave and violet is the shortest light wave#L-E
this is how we see different colored objects when you see a yellow flower it is because all the primary colors of light hit it red and green light bounce off of the flower into your eye#L-E
its the same with magenta except blue red nonces off#L-E
its also the same with cyan except blue green light bounces off#L-E
shadows are made when light hits an opaque object and so then it makes shadow the shadow is allays attacher to a opaque object#L-E
it depends on the time of day for the size of the shadow#L-E
a convex lens also helps focus the light#L-E
it dost focus the light#L-E
if you shine a light through a stem of water you will see a rainbow in the water#L-E
wen you see a red rose the blue and green are being absorbed and the red will be reflected and you see a red rose#L-E
wen you look at a yellow rose the to colors that are reflected are red and green they make yellow the blue is absorbed and you cant see it#L-E
other lights our when the sun boards the earth with tiny particles of belletristic they hit the earths attester the air and electricity makes it glow#L-E
a liner elicits is when the sun is behind the earth and the moons in front of the earth#L-E
light travels in inviable waves so it acts like a straight line but is actually waves#L-E
light wave length is shorter then ultra violet waves which are inviable to our eyes so some people still think that light travels in a straight line it was proved by many people a long time ago#L-E
a shadow is made by an opaque object nontransparent object and when you shine the light through the opaque object you can see a black spot that black spot is a shadow#L-E
solar panels are usably used in places where they want to absorb light what a solar panel is basically is a thing that absorbs light stead of reflecting light so it can give off light later on#L-E
you have three eye cones in your eyes to see different couplers like i said before the easy way to se many couplers is you need blue red and green so they are blue red and green#L-E
glowing things is that it needs to absorb light to work#L-E
a shadow is a reflection of light hitting an object to see a shadow you need a source of light like the sun or a flash light#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the sun over laps the moon band then the sun and the moon go red#L-E
this is how a shadow is made a shadow is made when light hits an object#L-E
this is why how you make a rainbow with a prism you get a prism and shine a light though the prism and then you will see a prism rainbow#L-E
how we make a rainbow with rain after it rains you see a rainbow its made by the sun light shining though the water and it makes a rainbow#L-E
solar panel absorb light and change it to solar energy#L-E
my theory about how light travels is that light travels in ripple waves#L-E
my theory about all we see is light is that every thing we see is light#L-E
the way a shadow is made is that you are covering part of where the light hits#L-E
my understanding of rainbows is that the reason that there always in the same order is that red has the longest light wave and violet the shortest#L-E
anything that isn't the same color gets absorbed the same color is always reflected#L-E
rainbows are sometimes made when leftover raindrops the raindrops acts as prisms#L-E
other things make things glow in the dark like electricity heat and friction#L-E
if you looked into a concave mirror you would see behind you and a lot of light because the light goes in then bounces until it shoots out the way it came#L-E
i learned that a solar eclipse occurs when the moon blocks the sun which casts a huge shadow over the earth#L-E
a shadow is made by light hitting you and the light is big so it gets around the person and makes a shadow#L-E
i also learned that there are things called atoms and electrons that can pass through wires and make electricity#L-E
the northern lights happen when the sun makes tiny bits of electricity go down to earth#L-E
if you look at a yellow flower the color that would absorb is blue and the colors that would bounce into your eyes are red and green#L-E
if you look at a red rose blue and green are absorbed into your eyes and red is reflected#L-E
when you see a rainbow you only see half of it a rainbow is actual a circle but the clouds are blocking the half of the rainbow that you don't see#L-E
if you look at a red rose in green light the rose doesn't absorb the green light so the rose appears black#L-E
fluorescence objects are glow in the dark objects a sea animal that lives under the water is glow in the dark and glow in the dark star stickers and bandages fluorescence objects are made be friction like two rocks rubbing together#L-E
a lunar eclipse is when the moon covers the sun long time ago a man predicted that there would be a lunar eclipse and he was right#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the sun covers the moon#L-E
my understanding about shadows is that when light hits you it creates a shadow my theory is that the light hits you and goes around you to make a shadow heres a picture to make it more simple#L-E
also they react like chemiluminescence witch is a process of changing chemic energy into light energy#L-E
solar panels absorb sun light rays and turn them into energy#L-E
to reflect colors the object has to be the same color to reflect the light colorto absorb light color the object has to be not the same color to be absorb#L-E
i think that light travels in straight lines and some other people think that light travels in waves i also think that light is a wave but it travels in straight lines i think light travels in straight lines in two ways#L-E
a rainbows are made by raindrops that act like a prism that make the rainbow#L-E
if you look at a green apple for a long time the green cone gets tired but the red and blue are not tired and together red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite color of green#L-E
most things that glow have some fluorescent paint on them this paint absorbs light and then glows until it has no more light absorbed in it#L-E
a shadow is made when darkness made when light shines on a opaque object#L-E
a liner eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the moon is between the sun and the earth#L-E
a shadow is made when a light source hits an object#L-E
a lunar eclipse is when the sun foe between the moon and casts a shadow#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon#L-E
i need to understand why you can get two different kinds of shadows one that is larger than you and one that is smaller than you my theory of what happens is that it appends on the time of day#L-E
what helps things that glow are fluorescence pink and other colors#L-E
if your body wants to see a red rose the red is bounced into your eyes and the other colors are absorbs#L-E
if your body wants to see a yellow green and red is bounced into you eyes and the blue is absorbed#L-E
solar panels takes in light and makes it in to energy#L-E
my understanding shadows starts at the shadow view if a light sours hits a optic nontransparent object which creates a shadow such as a person is standing behind a light sours and a shadow papers behind them#L-E
rain can can be used as prisms thats why theres a rainbow after it rains#L-E
a solar panel absorbs light and uses it as energy#L-E
fireflies produce light from their abdominals because of a chemical reaction caused by lucifer and lucifer this is called photoluminescence#L-E
this is how a glow stick works when you snap a glow stick it makes a little hole and to chemicals collide and then they glow this is called chemiluminescence#L-E
a shadow is made by standing in front of a light source and then the place you block up is where the shadow is made#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the moon passes in between the sun and the earth causing a big shadow#L-E
i thought glow in the dark could only happen with one thine but then i read yasmin note and saw that it happens with three things heat friction and electricity#L-E
in the shadows view i learned the closer the sun is to you the stronger it is#L-E
also i learned that your body blocked the sun and that creates a shadow the sun goes through the ground and makes a shadow for a root#L-E
a rainbow in rain is made because its so damp outside#L-E
we see a red rose because the primary colors go to the rose and green and blue get absorbed and red bounces off#L-E
we see a yellow rose because all the secondary colors go at the rose the magenta and cyan gets absorbed but yellow bounces off#L-E
a shadow is the darkness left behind when a light sours shines on a nontransparent object#L-E
a solar eclipse is when the moon blocks the sun light from coming to the earth#L-E
a lunar clips is when the sun blocks the moons light from going to earth#L-E
you can make a rainbow with a prism by outing light thought a prism of rain rain is what make the rainbow in the sky#L-E
solar panels are panels that use light to make electricity#L-E
all we see is light without light we can not see#L-E
to make a rainbow you need raindrops on plants then the sun shines on the plants then makes a rainbow#L-E
you can make a rainbow by holding up a prism to the sun the white light will go through the prism and make a rainbow#L-E
the northern lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky they occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity to small for us to see#L-E
solar panels take in the suns rays a make energy with them#L-E
lasers are the best wielding equipment that i no of because it saved the navy millions laser is short for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation#L-E
i think that light travels in a straight line because we did a lot of experiments and proved that it travels that way#L-E
light travels in a wave#L-E
the rainbow makes white light#L-E
when white light goes through a practicum it makes a rainbow#L-E
when white light goes through a rain drop it make a rainbow#L-E
when you see a red rose the red light bonus into our#L-E
when you see a yellow flower the yellow light bonus into our#L-E
when you see colored light or a rose so if you a red rose red light bonus into your eyes but blue green get absorb into the flower#L-E
my theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line#L-E
it is made when raindrops fall on something like a leaf and the sunshine shines through the leaf and the raindrop acts like a prism#L-E
when we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow#L-E
1 is it true that all we see is light my theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes#L-E
2 how do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque opaque light bounces off it into your eyes#L-E
transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly#L-E
translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects#L-E
reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off and blue light hit it it would absorb#L-E
if you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow#L-E
how we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down the solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around#L-E
how do out make a rainbow with a prism the white light goes in to the prism and it splits the light up into 7 different color s and those different colors are the colors of them rainbow#L-E
how you make a rainbow with rain rain acts likes prisms and do the same thing that prisms do#L-E
how you see a yellow rose red and green are reflected and all the other colors were absorbed#L-E
water refracting light is when light goes in the water after light is in air the light is bent by the water#L-E
an eclipse course when the earth or the moon blocks the suns light#L-E
a solar eclipse happens when the moon is between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the suns light#L-E
a shadow is when light is shewn on a opaque object and the shadow is what is behind the opaque object#L-E
light travels in all directions i need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else my theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight#L-E
all we see is light#L-E
if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed#L-E
we belove that a rain drop can make a rainbow 1 1382#L-E
i observed that when we humans think of apples we think of juciey treats that are a beloved fruits we don't think of the energy that is entering are body once we eat it i know the apple enters our system of are body ready to digest after being chewed and swallowed after it ids digested you feel like have more energy because you do the energy flows around our body for a whlie then it comes out my theroy is that the energy starts flowing throgh are bodys after 24 hours of digesting my question is that why are apples diffrent colors yet they can grow in the sam place#L-E
it is because of blood veins and vessils#L-E
my theory is that some foods are for your brain to help you get smarter#L-E
i think that when you eat the food goes into pieces and goes through your body and goes to you stomach#L-E
my theory is humans who try a food they first kinda of inspect whats inside then they first take small bites to see if they like it then if they like it eat the whole thing then once it then goes through your throat it goes through your lung and ribs then end up in your stomach but then it lturns into a lquid because of the acid that make into a lquid that is my theory#L-E
the human eats some kind of food and it goes down into the stomach and it gets digested#L-E
apples start out on an apple tree then they gey picked probably by a farmer and get delivered to your local grocery store this is how the apples get to us#L-E
some energy lasts longer than other energy the energy in candy lasts shorter than energy in fruit and that's why you feel more full when you eat fruit than when you eat candy#L-E
i just wanted to add that it is not that simple and it also goes throgh your througt and into your stomach then gets diagested by acids and then goes down in where it gets sent down and all the nutrients inside it go into the body and waste goes outside of the body#L-E
when we swallow food our body turns the ingredients to energy the energy begins once you swallow it into your body then ends in your digestive system the way our body uses the energy is by moving doing activities and doing everyday things#L-E
when you first take a bite on a apple your teeth and your saliva suck up the sugar while you chew the apple up then the chewed up apple goes through your throat and in your throat it gets more chewed up and goes to your digestive system#L-E
plants get energy a little different than we do plants feed of the sun and soil that gives them energy to grow fruits we get energy from the plants fruits just like plants we eat and a little differently from plants we poop out our food but do we poop out all of it im not shure what this part of your digistive system it is called but i do know it seaves as a filter to filter out the bad and keep the good i am wondering if the good stuff we keep is the energy we can use#L-E
well actually you do not poop the whole plant only part of the plant so you can get nutrition#L-E
we get engery by eating nutrients but you can also get energy by eating sugar now i am not saying you can only eat sugar but you can get some energy by eating sugar mostly you get nutrients from freshly grown products like cucumbers or any vegetable#L-E
humans are a major part of our ecosystem so this is the perfect next unit am i right#L-E
doctors need blood blood is your body's water bottle it takes oxygen and nutrience from the body blood is made out of our bones called bone marrow goes through the lungs and to other parts its based on your heart blood is made out of our bone#L-E
when we eat the apple the energy travels throught the body that's why we need to eat so that we can have some energy#L-E
growth plates are hard to stop the growth plates make bone little by little the growth plate grows the bone and builds on like a like a cast and but without a cast and grows by itself its a skin cast if you sprain your growth platelike i did you will need a cast if you break it like i did you will still need a cast#L-E
first of all the food doesn't really decompose in your stomach the food really breaks down in your stomach first the saliva in your mouth help you break down the food#L-E
what i know about arms is that when i go and scare my sis she blocks her sellf with her arms and she dose that because her nearve system says thats the fastest way to protect your sellf#L-E
that is what i was thinking because white blood cells fight off sicknesess#L-E
the digestive system uses acid to break down the food you eat then the nutrients go to your body and the waste comes out of well you know#L-E
i know that the apple sugar goes to the blood i wonder how the blood can get you stronger and healthier my theory is when the sugar goes to the blood the blood gets more healthier and then your muscles work much better#L-E
from the right atrium blood is pumped into the right ventricle from the right ventricle blood is pumped to to your lungs through the pulmonary arteries the left ventricle pumps the blood to the rest of your body through the aorta for the heart to work well your blood must flow in only one direction#L-E
what i know is that the heart also pumps blood and if it didnt then we would have 1 lest shot at the docters office who ho#L-E
my theory is one reason your heart needs to be healthy is that you need oxygen and nutrients if you have those to it would take the waste food out of your body#L-E
my theory is one reason is that you need to keep you heart healthy is that you need oxygen and nutrients if you have those thing it would take all of the waste of out of your body#L-E
the are jonits in your body like your neck your elbow and morethere is cartilage that keeps you from having an injury every time you movesyovial fluid that gose inside your cartlage and makes it more comfortable and like your sliding on the snow#L-E
the most common cause of anterior nosebleeds is dry air a dry climate or heated indoor air irritates and dries out nasal membranes causing crusts that may itch and then bleed when scratched or picked colds may also irritate the lining of the nose bleeding may occur after repeated blowing#L-E
actually the food gets broken apart in the stomach and then the acids in the small intestine flow into the intestine then that breaks the food down just to nutrients#L-E
the brain is an important part of your body because the brain gives a request so the heart keeps working if the brain wasn't here then you wouldn't even be alive#L-E
the way that you control your body because of your brain and your spinal cord what i know is that the brain connects to the spinal cord and the spinal cord sends out branches which control your body#L-E
immune system your immune sytem is a process of white blood cells that kill bacteria the white blood cells in the immune system is leukocytes and if you did not have an immune system a simple cold could kill people very quickly#L-E
cf is a desese where you are born with it and it could effect your lungs my theory to get cf your parents need to be carrers of cf#L-E
my theory is that the brain sends the other parts of the body signals through energy waves#L-E
the immune sytem is made up of differnt things including mucus skin antibodys white blood cells and stomach acid without your immune system something as minor as a paper cut could be fatal your immune sytem relies on leukocytes#L-E
one way that the brain allows us to control our body parts is that our brain is connected to the spinal cord which sends out branches that connect to our body parts and allow us to control them at our will#L-E
mechanical digestion is when your body physicaly breaks down your food chemical digestion is when a chemical called enzymes breaks down your food my theory my theory is mechanical digestion is when you chew your food and chemical digestion is when your spit breaks down the food and it is helped by mechanical digestion#L-E
when you work out you breath more because you need more nutrients for your muscles and if you have any waste in your body it eliminates all the waste in your body so that is why your heart needs to beat faster when you work out#L-E
the nervous system is the reason we can sit up straight and feel things the brain spinal cord and a series of nerves work together to create the nervous system without it our brain would be mush and we wouldn't be able to realize things i wonder if without the nervous system we would be able to live#L-E
i don't think we would be able to live because if we are unaware of what is going on we would most likely be hit by cars or have something bad happen because you were not paying attion#L-E
my theory is your lungs are not connected to your digestive system#L-E
i need to understand how humans use air to live my theory is that the lungs play a huge role in this process oxygen is a translucent oderless clear gas that is very essential to life without air we wouldn't be able to live air in the earth's atmosphere consists of about 79 percent nitrogen 20 percent oxygen and 1 percent other gases such as argon and carbon dioxide#L-E
i need to understand how the brain controlls your body my theory is that the brain sends electric charges through nreruon cells#L-E
new information the digestive system is a group of organs working together to convert food into energy and basic nutrients to feed the entire body food passes through a long tube inside the body known as the alimentary canal or the gastrointestinal tract the job of the digestive system is to break down the food we eat into smaller units called nutrients#L-E
new information in the digestive system the stomach stretches the juices that get digestion under way#L-E
some new information is that their are such thing as cf diabites because cf kids can eat too much sugar and if they get cfd then they need much more treatment thatn useal#L-E
what i have studied is how long does it take to digest food i learned that it matters on what you have eaten and how much you eat if you eat fattening food and you eat large amount of food then you might go to the bathroom a bit faster but if you eat healthy foods and eat and large amount you might not go to the bathroom as fast it matters on your digetsive system#L-E
the way that dreams come when you sleep is because the dream is built up of what you have seen over the day and the week#L-E
that is weird because once i had a dream about something that i hadn't even been thinking about that day week rem is weird i'm also wondering why does the brain bring certain things together and have certain patterns in dreams and nightmares#L-E
the brain brings certain things together because the brain thinks that these things that you have seen are important to you such as a movie or trip that you have gone on#L-E
the atrium brings blood back into the heart and pass it to the ventricles which pump the blood back out#L-E
how seasonal allergies workyou inhale pollenand germs from flowers and theyget in your system and attack your blood cells and the cells release a mucus that spread across your body and make your throat itchy and watery eyes#L-E
my theory is that when you are working outmany of your muscles will get weak and those muscles will all need nutrients and to throw away most of the waste products in your body at the same time so when you work out your heart will need more blood so that your muscles can have nutrients for them and get weak all te time#L-E
my theory is when you breath you're body sends a sighnel to your muscalds#L-E
"blood carries nutrients and oxygen to the tissues of the body including your muscles a very complicated network of blood vessels called arteries takes deoxygenatd blood from the muscles back to the heart it also gets rid of products we don""t need in our muscles"#L-E
the pons are used as a message station in the brain without pons your body would not be able to function because the brain would have no way to get messages from the cerebellum to the brain stem#L-E
cystic fibrosis is a progressive genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time#L-E
i don't think you can do that because i think the brain has different sections of the brain that control your body and your thoughts#L-E
if you had no imune system you would have so many diseases you could die#L-E
my theory is that if you eat fatining food then you digest it faster that healthy food#L-E
there are ten organs that help you digest food and the one that i am studing is the liver the liver is when the food goes in the liver and makes it small and then goes to your stomach#L-E
new information when you eat anything like an apple it goesall of you parts in the digestive system and goes through the small intestine and goes to the blood vessels#L-E
dreams are made up of things that you have seen in the past day or few days you might get nightmares because you saw a horror movie or if you wint in a hounted house if you have a good dream it might be because you sawa good thing that day#L-E
people with cf can do most things that we can do and people with cf cough more than us they cough a lot which is normal don't forget if people with cf cough on you cf is not contagious#L-E
dreams accour about two hours a night rem rapped eye movement is when your eyes jump around under your eyelids and that is when your dreams accour rem happens for about 10 minutes to an hour and with your dreams they have strong emotions with them#L-E
"your heart is an involentary muscle that means that you can't control it experiment feel your pulse then think very hard "" i want my heart to stop "" your heart will not stop or else you would die"#L-E
new information i learned that the blood in the heart go inside the right atrium then goes through a valve to the right ventricle and then the blood goes to the lungs to get oxygen after that it goes through the right atrium and goes through a valve that goes to the right ventricle then they go out through the body and the cycle starts all over again my theory is that all of blood travels through the heart really quickly#L-E
calcium is a mineral that helps bones stay strong and healthy our bones remove calcium thats why we have calcium every night because if we didnt have it our bones would become softer and would make it easy to hurt them#L-E
anatomically your brain isn't a muscle although it contains a bit of muscle it's predominantly gray and white matter with cellular structure and function far different and more complex than that of a muscle#L-E
having a high tempature is good because it helps fight bacteria#L-E
different blood types then hemolysis the destruction of red blood cells can occur hemolysis can cause kidney damage or even death so to prevent this blood is classified into one or four blood groups in the abo blood system#L-E
my theory the brain is procesing a lot of information in less then a blink of an eye for an example you can proces an image in 1 3 of a second the brain always trys to understand what we are looking at to remeber the thing you just saw takes less time the you can blink it also can get 135 words transfered to it in a minute#L-E
new information 1 way that heart holes form is that in the heart there is a flap that is not suppossed to open the problem is in some body the flap will open the oppening of the flap can cause a lot of problems not just in the heart for example some strokes form and strokes have to happen in the brain#L-E
the heart doesn't produce blood but i think a different organ does that job of making blood#L-E
the amount of blood in your body will normaly take up 7 persent of your body does weight but that is just a estamate you also have to take into acount you age gender and how much you weigh#L-E
sleep is to clear your mind so you can be fresh when you are learning and helps your memory it removes all the waste from your brain when your brain is searching for something to do it dreams#L-E
people have dreams when they are sleeping because you don't use your brain when your brain is in search to do something dreams usually your dreams include things already in your memory#L-E
when you breathe in your diaphragm tightens and moves downward this increases the space in your chest cavity into which your lungs expand the intercostal muscles between your ribs also help enlarge the chest cavity they contract to pull your rib cage both upward and outward when you inhale#L-E
did you know that you can get cystic fibrosis in your lungs it captures unhealthy stuff like germs and bacteria when we cough it up out go those harmful microbes#L-E
when you have sleep parlice it you are in the rem state of sleep and you brain makes you muscels not move so that you don't run in your dream when you wake up you could see things that are not reallly there then you see that it is strangling you and you try to move but you can't so you think that the thing that you saw is trying to kill you and then you wake up totally and find that it was nothing but you are still scared in diffrent parts of the world different things come and visit you#L-E
i agree and also people's sleep paralysis gets really strong that they think it happens in real life and they need to go to atherapist and help their condition grow out of it and sleep paralysis have it from their family or if you have seen a lot of scary stuff in your life or maybe if you were an preist before and you quit you can face sleep paralysis and it would be scary and sleep paralysis can also cause sleep walking#L-E
apraxia is a disorder where part of yout cerebrum does not function correctly people with apraxia can understand when you talk and they can also understand everything a normal person can understand the only thing different with a victom of apraxia is that the part of there cerebrum that controlls speech can't form words as people without apraxia can#L-E

i don't agree to this your brain stem does not send messeges to your body your brain tells your nerves to move and do stuff with your body also you brain stem does not control your feeling its in your limbic system which makes you have feelings so when you said you wouldn't be able to cry without your brain stem that false infomation also its true if you don't have your brain stem you could die because you couldn't brath or pump blood#L-E

new information i learned that there is a part in at the root of the tongue called the epiglottisand is very important because what it does is when its open that's when you are breathing so air goes into the lungs and when you swallow or eat it closes the tube to the windpipe which leads to the lungs so air doesn't go into your lungs#L-E
let's say you get sleep paralysis which i hope you don't because it is very scary and it could cause coma but first let's stay to how sleep paralysis happens ok so sleep paralysis begins when you go to sleep and your brain goes to a semisleeping time or rem part of sleep raped eye movement but your brain goes in that state but your body does not fall asleep so when you sleep everything that happens in your dream happens in your real body if you want to read what happens next then wait until i make anothor note and it will be there#L-E
well like you said the appendix has an unknown job i do agree with you though that it might store the good bacteria i agree with you about the appendix storing the good bacteria becaus of it's location the appendix is right after the end off the small intestine the waste will go onto the large intestine the large intestine will take all the waste to the rectum therefore if there was some good bacteria from the waste it couldv'e been brought to the appendix it could be stored there plus if the appendix is located right where the waste goes the bacteria could be delivered right to the appendix#L-E

new information that i have found is the leaves are green beacause of chorophyll chorophyll is green it absorbs the sunlight and water the help to make sugar for the tree plants use chorophyll to make food also leaves have things inside them called pigments which are colored red yellow orange and also purple you can't see them because during the summer there is so much chorophyll it overrides it but during the fall there is less sunlight and the chorophyll slowly starts to fade and thats why the leaves change color#L-EE
all birds have feathers for different reasons like the penguins have feathers to keep warm chickens have feathers because they also need to keep warm they also need them to flutter up to places only a few feet above the ground turkeys need feathers also to flutter up to places and to keep warm and penguins have a thick layer of blubber under their feathers to keep warm in the extreme cold#L-EE
before the btb was blue because it had no carbon dioxide once we blew human air into it it turned green because human air has c02 when we put a plant into the btb it turned green because plants take in carbon dioxide and the plant took in the carbon dioxide and made it turn back to blue#L-EE

first of all the cycle starts off as a seed then the seed gets carbon dioxide water sunlight to grow after it gets all of those things the seed turns into a small tree and grows out of the ground this is when the tree also starts to grow roots after this step the small tree turns into an apple tree this is when the tree grows apples after the tree starts getting weak it loses its apples when the apples fall to the ground and die the seeds are exposed they go back in the ground or the wind blows them away and moves them to some place else this is how the cycle keeps on going#L-EE
i know that ants are decomposers when they eat they leave a trail of left over bits of food that add nutrients to the soil i know that ants are aggressive i learned that the ant population can impact the population of other species in an area if the ant population goes down other species in that area will go up my theory if an ant population goes up other species'population will go down many ants work together to 'take out' other species a better theory without ants and other decomposers the soil would not get nutrients without the nutrients inthe soil the plants that grow there would not get what they need to grow strong with nutrients then the animals that eat the plants won't have the best nutrients they need humans who eat the animals that eat the plants won't get the nutrients they need to get bigger and stronger and survive in healthy ways ants are an interesting and important species i need to understand what are the nutrients in the soil that plants and animals and humans need#L-EE
i learned that at first i thought that moss did not have any roots but now i found out that moss actually moss has tiny small roots and that moss is eukaryotic meaning their cells have nucleus that also contain cell wall called cellulose there also autotrophic which means they make their own food they also carry a photosynthesis witch makes carbon carbon dioxide into sugar in order for moss to grow in other places there has to be other moss to send around spores if it lands somewhere with the right temperature than it can grow correctly seedless plants are separated into different groups vascular and nonvascular vascular have canals that carry water throughout their body nonvascular plants or bryophytes instead of collecting water from there roots they collect water though there thin cell walls they donât grow more than a few centimeters tall thin rootlike rhizoids holds the plants down and also absorb water from the ground you will find bryophytes all around the world mostly in rain forests and ponds and streams mosses are the most common bryophytes clumped in layers on tree trunks the ground or even rocks moss and liverworts were the first plants to live harsh places#L-EE
i used to think that not alot of insects can live in moss because moss insects are pretty big like a big ant but thereâs a insect called a tardigrade a tardigrade is a insect that lives in or around moss so if a tardigrade can live in moss that mean other insects can live or can they because a tardigrade is microscopic so thereâs a lot of space for the tardigrade now i think that moss canât really provide a home or insects because a ant lives underground so if ants lives on moss when it rain the rain will wash the ants away#L-EE
i used to think that the air moves by itself now i know that the sun makes the air move and that the sun has to be in a certain area to push the wind it's the low pressure system as the warm air rises it cools of and eventually sinks back down the system is like a big engine taking in air all around it that gets you a lot of moving air#L-EE
i ve learned that all living things are linked together by what they eat for example say if there were no more shrimp the amount animals that eat the shrimp will start to decrease and it would just keep on decreasing also did you know that the food web can contain lost and lots of animals in it the food web has three main elements producers consumers and decomposers producers are plants they make their own food out of the sun also known as photosynthasis the producers are mostly at the bottom of the food chain consumers can't make their own food so they eat the producers primary consumers are herbavors secondary consumers are carnivors and some consumers are omnivors also there are parasite cosumers decomposers are mostly bacteria they help to brake down dead animals or dead plants or any of those dead things#L-EE
leaves have unique structures called veins that transport liquids and nutrients to leaf cells veins also carry the products of photosynthesis back to the rest of the tree a tree leaf has several types of veins the central one is called the midrib or midvein other veins connect to the midrib and have their own unique patterns tree leaf veins in dicots we also call these trees hardwoods or deciduous trees are all considered to be netveined or reticulateveined this means that the veins branch from the main rib and then subbranch into finer veins there are two classifications you need to#L-EE

parts of a plantthe blade is broad and flat a stalk attaches the blade to the stem a simple leaf has one bade and a compond leaf has several blades on the same petiole veins in the leave carry food and water from the leaves to the rest of the plant they also make a strong support that give the leaves its shape the veins of a broad leaf form a netlike pattern the veins of narrow leaves are parallel leaves size are also adapted by habitat and maximize photosynthesis#L-EE
photosynthesis occurs when a plant soaks up water through its roots absorbs carbon dioxide co2 through openings in the leaves called stomata and stores energy from sunlight as chemical energy the water travels up the plant's stem through a transport tissue calledxylem the water and co2 spread through the leaves into cells calledthe palisades and the spongy cells the cells are filled with structures called chloroplasts which contain a green pigment called chlorophyll chlorophyll splits the water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen atoms the sunlight chemical energy is used to create glucose from the hydrogen and carbon dioxide the glucose dissolves into extra water molecules and gives the plant an extra boost of energy that it needs to grow the plant gives off the oxygen atoms as a waste product#L-EE
"photosynthesis starts off with the sun when the sun is not blocked the sunlight goes to plants and gives the plants energy notes plants make carbon dioxide into sugar from sunlight plants use stuff like air h2o carbon dioxide and sunlight to make there own food when plans make there own food and ""eat"" it they release water"#L-EE

wait hailey i think you are right but the spores are not only for the wind they are also for the moss to grow let me explain it to you as part of the first plant family to colonize earth the soft beds of mosses that now grace mountain streams and woodlands may have shaped our planetâs history primitive mosses similar to the hundreds of moss species found in appalachia might have triggered two cool periods around 455 million years ago according to a recent study published earlier this year in nature geoscience the study suggests that early mosses clinging to prehistoric rocks sped up the weathering of certain minerals from those rocks the release of these minerals accelerated the pace of carbon sequestration leading to cooler temperatures that paved the way for further plant and animal evolution#L-EE
why do animals mostly die in the winter and where do they go to hibernate if they do survive i learned why they hibernate because it's cold and the weather through outside animals coming hunt for them so they have to hibernate swag so they have to get food and shelter before other animals do a lot of website to find out what happened to animals is google search the web and chrome it was the most places where you can go other animals eat the snow animals to get more energy for the night period every man for himself and animal from self again some animals hibernate some animals migrate#L-EE

pollution in the waterthe main sources of water pollution are discharge of untreated raw sewage from households and factories chemicals dumped from factories human littering in rivers oceans lakes and other bodies of water the great pacific garbage patch is one of the main sources of pollution in the water it is known for its many garbage and plastic every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans there may now be around 5 25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean weighing up to 269 000 tons in developing countries 70 percent of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into waters polluting the usable water supply polluted water can cause serious diseases some of these waterborne diseases are typhoid cholera paratyphoid fever dysentery jaundice amoebiasis and malaria chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health pesticides â can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain each year 1 2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage stormwater and industrial waste are dumped into us water while children make up 10% of the world's population over 40% of the global burden of disease falls on them more than 3 million children under age five die annually from environmental factors âapproximately 40% of the lakes in america are too polluted for fishing aquatic life or swimming â âeach year 1 2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage stormwater and industrial waste are dumped into us water â eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land#L-EE
water is essentially everywhere in our world the average human is composed od between 55 and 60% water so what role does water play in our bodies and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy water is virtually everywhere from soil moisture and ice caps to cells inside our own bodies depending on the factors like location fat index age and sex the average human is between 5560% water at birth babies are even wetter being 75 water they are swimmingly similar to fish but their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday so what role does water play in your bodies and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy the h20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints regulate temperature and to nourish the brain and spinal cord water isnât only in our blood an adultâs brain and heart are almost three quarters full of water thatâs roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana lungs are more closer to an apple at 83% and even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water if we are essentially made of water and surrounded by water why do we still need to drink so much#L-EE
we can see a yellow rose because red blue and green are going to the flower red and green bounce into your eyes but blue absorbs#L-EE
you can see a red rose because red bounces of and goes into your eyes blue and green get absorbed#L-EE
when you see a red flower the red light bounces off the flower in to our eyes and the green blue gets absorbed#L-EE
when you shine a light through a glass prism it ell make a rainbow on the surface it needs to be white light of the colors light wail be to strong and wont split up into the rainbow#L-EE
this is how absorbing and reflecting works the colors that make the object will be reflected and the leftover color will be wasted not used#L-EE
a shadow is mad by an object in front of a light stream the light cant go around and then no light git be hind the objects and its dark#L-EE
a solar eclipse is an eclipse of the sun it occurs when the moon is located between the sun and the earth the moon blocks the sunlight coming to the earth#L-EE
my theory is that light travels in waves i leaned this by doing an ensnarement the end resale was a wave pattern like doping to pebbles in a pond and the reason is like light#L-EE
most glowing things are painted with a layer of fluorescent paint this paint absorbs light and when it is dark the absorbed light would unleash the light that it saved until its empty and has no more light#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is the opiate of a solar eclipse a lunar eclipse is when the earth goes in front of the moon the earth is also opaque but the shadow this time is bigger#L-EE
if light hits a red rose red gets reflected and blue and green get absorbed thats why we see red#L-EE
but with a yellow rose green and red get reflected and blue gets absorbed because red and green make yellow#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the moon over laps the sun and blackens out the sky so no one ca see the sun and the sun and the moon turn black#L-EE
what is absorbing my understanding is that when white light hits a red object all the colors that make white red green and blue blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed#L-EE
what is reflecting my understanding is like before we have a red dress when white light hits the red dress blue and green are reflected and red is absorbed why i think there reflected is because its not the same color#L-EE
this is how we can see a red rose white light hits the rose red is reflected and blue and green are absorbed and the rose papers upside down and back wards but your brain turns it to the right way#L-EE
new information a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon since the earth is in front of the moon it castes a shadow over the moon making it in total darkness#L-EE
a solar eclipse is when the moon casts a show over the earth and its just like a lunar eclipse precept what i just told you#L-EE
the way we see a red rose is that white light contains the primary coleus of light red blue and green what happens is that the red light hitting a red rose the red light bounces off and into our eyes and the other colors get absorbed#L-EE
with a yellow ors its pretty much the same thing but 2 colors don't get absorbed they mix and bounce off as one ray#L-EE
the northern lights are cosed by partials from the sun the particles are so small you couldn't see them how they acute is when the particles hit highest thing of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air making it glow#L-EE
convex mirrors are used in stores they let you see around corners and stuff ltd shaped like a ball with the top cut off the way it lets you see around corners is it does everything but catch light so it bounces off as an angle#L-EE
all we see is light the way i can prove it is that the same color light bounces off things that are supposed to be that color then the color bounces into your eye three primary colors are in white light so if you mix those you'll get any color#L-EE
i just learned that a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth is between the sun and the moon the earth is in front of the moon and behind the sun which makes a huge shadow over the moon#L-EE
this is how rainbows are made with rain the sky is still moist and there are drops in the air which can be used like prisms so if the left over raindrops can be used like prisms then the light can shine through it to make a rainbow#L-EE
i think light travels in a straight line because the shadows prove that they travel straight or else the shadows would be wobbly#L-EE
if you look at a red rose in magenta light the magenta light red and blue hits the red surface the color red is reflected but the color blue is absorbed then the rose appears red#L-EE
my understanding about a lunar eclipse is that when the earth is between the sun and the moon the sun casts a shadow over the moon called a lunar eclipse#L-EE
my theory's that light travels in a wave line because if you drive behind a bus you'll see heat that looks wave#L-EE
shadows a shadow is an inexact reflection of your body that shows on a very sunny day when you are outside you see your shadow when you happen to be outside and you look down at the ground also your shadow touches you wherever you touch the ground#L-EE
we see a red rose when there is a flashlight or another light source that will shine on the rose and absorb the green and blue light and reflect the red light into our eyes#L-EE
and how we see a yellow rose is that it is the same but the red and green light are reflected and blue is absorbed#L-EE
how do you make a rainbow with rain the sky is still wet with raindrops and the sunlight shines through the drops and a rainbow forms in the sky make a rainbow with a prism exactly the same way#L-EE
the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis and they are lights in the sky that are mixtures of colors that are seen only in the northern parts of the world and that is why they are called the northern lights#L-EE
why are northern lights different colors each gas in earths atmosphere glows with its own color when it becomes charged with electricity oxygen gives off an eerie green glow nitrogen glows red and neon gas turns pink#L-EE
i also learned that a solar eclipse happens when the moon blocks the sun which makes a large shadow over the earth that is why when your outside and the sun dispersals its just a large shadow#L-EE
i also learned that a lunar eclipse is caused when the earth is between the sun and the moon#L-EE
also if your looking at a yellow flower the blue light would be absorbed allowing the two other colors to both making yellow would bounce of into your two sensitive cone to those colors#L-EE
the northern lights are caused by the sun bombarding the earth with tiny partials of electricity when these partials hit the highest part of the hates atmosphere it electrolysis the air and makes it glow#L-EE
to make a rainbow with rain it in voles moisture in the air and since there is moisture in the air the moistness acts like a prism#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is right in between the sun and the moon winch casts a shadow over the moon making the moon total darkness#L-EE
solar panels are used for sucking up sunlight and using the sunlight for something such as a solar powered windmill that works by the sunlight getting sucked into a solar panel and the light moves the windmill#L-EE
a red rose looks red because the red light in the white light reflects of the rose and in to your eyes the blue and green light gets absorbed#L-EE
a yellow flower looks yellow because the red and the green light in the white light are reflexed in to you eyes and the blue is absorbed#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the sun and the moon and it casts a shadow over the moon#L-EE
inside luminous objects or animals some form of energy changes into light energy this energy usually changes into chemical electrical thermal and nuclear energy the process of giving off light is called incandescence#L-EE
you have three eye cones in your eyes one is sensitive to red one is sensitive to blue and one is sensitive to green so when you see something blue the blue eye cone starts getting sensitive so you can see the color#L-EE
when we look at a red rose the red eye cone color bounces off into our eye and the other two colors absorb so you see the color of the rose#L-EE
my understanding of light the colors of light light is made up of many many different colors you cannot see those colors because those colors mixed together to get white light white light is transparent so you cant see it#L-EE
when it rains the raindrops split the light so you can see 7 discolored orange yellow green blue indigo and violet that make a rainbow#L-EE
that is why when you look at a yellow thing the red and green light bounce of it but blue gets absorbs mixes and comes to your eye as yellow#L-EE
there are also things called solar panels they are made to catch light the light that they catch is used to make electricity solar panels probably have a lot of tubes connected#L-EE
a shadow is the darkness on the other side of an opaque object whits is nontransparent when a light shines on an opaque object the light cant get around it so there is only darkness whits is a shadow#L-EE
a lunate eclipse is when the art goes between the moon and the sun the sun hits the eart and the eart casts a shadow on the moon winch give the moon total darkness#L-EE
a solar eclipse is when the moon is in the middle and blocks the light from hitting the earth making that side dark#L-EE
people make shadows by just standing in the light because light travels in a titrate line or waveland it hits a portion or thing and the blocks the light so it cant reach the ground and thee for makes an outline of that object#L-EE
shadow my theory is that all the light gets around but it doesn't get past your body so it is dark and the shape of your body#L-EE
a solar eclipse it happens when the moon is located between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the sunlight#L-EE
solar energy solar panels are dark so they attract heat and the sun is turned into thermal energy in the panels there are little tubes and the water gets warmer the warm water is pumped into a storage tank and it heats the house#L-EE
the northern lights are red pink ghostly greens the northern lights happen when the sun bombards earth with particles that are electric when they hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and it glows#L-EE
a lunar eclipse is when the earth is between the moon and the sun in which the sun shines on earth and makes a shadow on the moon which makes the moon in total darkness#L-EE
if a white light is shined on a red flower the green and blue is absorbed and the red is reflected that is how we see a red flower#L-EE
but that doesn't explain why sometimes there are rainbows after rain storms or when it rains the answer to this is raindrops act as prisms but when i did a experiment at my house i filled a glass of water and turned out the lights i didn't see even a tiny outline of a rainbow#L-EE
there are two types of eclipses the rift one is called a solar eclipse its when the moon goes in front of the earth and behind the sun which casts a shadow upon earth as i said before an opaque object like the moon and the sun is the light source it makes a shadow#L-EE
this is how we see a yellow rose the white light hits the rose green and red are reflected and blue is absorbed why green and red are reflected incited of just one color is because yellow is a secondary color and are brain sees the rose upside down and backwards#L-EE
diffused reflection is when a ray of light comes and hits something like bumpy tinfoil the light comes and egos everywhere because it has more than one thing to bounce off of it it egos up down right left because when its bumpy it goes like that because of different bumps#L-EE
here is how solar panels work dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light the dark surfaces absorb the suns rays and turn the rays into thermal energy the thermal energy is turned into heated water and then it is pumped into a storage tank and goes out through a fan that means that black attracts heat#L-EE
this is my picture of a light bulb a light bulb is made out of glass and artificial light the glass is to couscous the light to the spot you would like it and the artificial light is from the energy in the air that comes from your wall when you plug in a light a computer or anything that has a plug the energy goad through whores that travel over our hes and under us these 2 things are all plugd into a wall#L-EE
the picture i drew was making a rainbow out of a prism this picture is with two prisms this is how it works if you shine a light on a prism a rainbow will appear but if you put another prism in front of the other prism the light will turn white again this is how to make white light through a viable spectrum#L-EE
also you can see a green object because white light shines on that object white light has red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet in it and the object absorbs all the colors except green which is reflected into the eyes of the person that is looking at the object#L-EE
the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the incident ray goes on the mirror and makes the angle of incidence there is an invisible line between the angle and ray of incidence and the angle and ray of reflection the reflection ray is the reflection of the incident ray#L-EE
the northern lights are ribbons of red pink and ghostly green lights that dance and shimmer for hours across the sky they occur when the sun bombards earth with tiny particles of electricity too small for us to see when these particles hit the highest part of the earths atmosphere they electrify the air and make it glow#L-EE
my theory's that light travels in waves because when we did an experiment with progesterone and a tennis ball hanging from the vealing on a piece of string and when we shone light on it the tennis balls shader was clear but the strings shadow had some light on it#L-EE
dull dark surfaces do not reflect much light so they are perfect for solar panels instead they absorb the suns rays and turn them into thermal energy this means that on a roof there are dark hoses of water the water heats up because the hoses are absorbing the suns rays and they are isolated the heated water is pumped into a storage tank where it used to heat the house#L-EE
when looking at a red rose you need light right you do so when your looking at that objetc the light shines on it and since it is red it refletcs the red light off the objetc and all the other colors get absorbed its the same with any other color including yellow green etc#L-EE
shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object if the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror if there is no light there isn't a shadow so there is a shadow where the light cant reach#L-EE
when we had the class debate i was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves and now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight that means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves it depends on how you look at it or what your experiment is trying to prove in our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines thomas young experiment#L-EE
the way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color the green light keeps going until it goes into your eye then the brain identifies what color and it is#L-EE
cones tire easily if you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired so when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple and purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel#L-EE
this is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order as you know there are seven colors that we know of they all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed but when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed for some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest#L-EE
a thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights this happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun the sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic the earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow the colors that glow are red pink and green#L-EE
1 how do you think light travels my theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going my theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines like a flashlight that also explains why light is hot#L-EE
metabolism link chem4kids com files bio_metabolism html sugar link chem4kids com files bio_carbos html when you eat the food you chew it into a soft sphere that can fit down the esophagus once you swallow your food goes down your esophagus and lands in your stomach where acids break down your food once that is done nutrients are extracted in the small intestine after that you don't want to know once the sugar gets in your bloodstream it goes inside your cells and into the mitochondria there sugar by the way it'sc sub 6 sub h sub 12 sub o sub 6 is mixed with oxygen to make energy adenosine triphosphate or atp water and carbon dioxide sub#L-EE
"humans get energy by getting food and water into their stomach however for the humans to get energy the food needs to first grow so let's take an orange for example first the sun will give energy to a type of plant the plant will become a fullgrownplant and then things will start to grow on the plant the things on the plat are oranges then the oranges will be eaten by a human however the human first needs to eat the orange and then the orange will need to go into the human's body first it will go into the esophagus a "" tube"" that leads to your stomach now the energy is in your stomach but some of the food will continue to go through the small intestine and the large intestine which will soon be digested"#L-EE
"the digestive system is the food processor that is in your body to start the digestive system you first have to eat something then the food will go down your esophagus the esophagus is a ""tube"" that goes through your throat once the food reaches the stomach the food gets mixed with gases and chemicals the food will stay here for a littlewhile until the next step of the process then there is the small intestine that is the place where many of the nutrients from the food absorb juices from the liver and the pancreas also join the chyme in the small intestine then the digestive juices become into small moleculesthat will absorb into the bloodstream then eventually after another process in the small intestine the chyme will go into the large intestine a large intestineis a place where many of the water gets sucked out the digested chyme thishappens the process named absorption after most of the water is absorbed the waste goes to the rectum finally when there is enough waste you go to the bathroom this process usually takes 34 days so that'sis what the digestive system is like"#L-EE
the digestive system is a very important system there are many body parts involved in this systeem the body part that does the most work in the digestive sytem is the small intestine first your stomach will make a squishy mixture called chyme juices from body parts such as the liver and the panacreas will also join the chyme in the small intestine molecules are made the molecules are made out of the nutrients from thr food that you ate to make the molecules the juices will help the chyme break apart after the molecules are made they will be brought to your vains the molecules will absorb into the blood which will take the molecules all over the body the molecules go to body parts such as the heart what about the rest of the waste parts of the food your body doesnt need will be brought to the large intestine there all the water absorbs out of the food when there is enough waste piled up its time to go to the bathroom#L-EE
the digestive system starts when you eat the food then it goes down your esophagus to your stomach where acids and gases work together to break down the food but where do the gases come from my theory is that they come from the acids but that is only me once the food is broken down it travels to the small intestine then more acids break down the nutrients even more than the small intestine absorbs the food and the nutrients travel to different parts of the body to provide energy and the food that the body doesn't need goes into the large intestine which compacts the food together then the waste leaves the body this whole process takes about 2643 hours info from my mommy and daddy and brainpop#L-EE
each intestine has a different purpose the intestines may seem like the same thing but they each have a different purpose the large intestine is mainly about where the waste is made while the small intestine is more used for the nutrients so they can be brought to different parts of your body small intestine the small intestine is one of the main parts of the digestive system first juices from body parts such as the liver will join the chyme after that in the small intestine the nutrients from the chyme will become into small molecules the small molecules will be absorbed into your blood and they will be brought to different body parts your bloodstream goes up and down your body so blood goes to many body parts suh as the brain large intestine the large intestine is where the waste gets ready to be released the chyme is brought from the small intestine to the large intestine after much of the waste is combined the water will absorb out from the waste when enough water is absorbed it's time to go to the bathroomtherefore both intestines are very important but they have a different purpose#L-EE
the muscles of the small intestine mix food with digestive juices from the pancreas liver and intestine and push the mixture forward to help with further digestion the walls of the small intestine absorb the digested nutrients into the bloodstream the blood delivers the nutrients to the rest of thebody#L-EE
molecules get to your brain by the blood stream in your body in the small intestine the chyme becomes into many little small molecules these little molecules are small enough to be absorbed into your blood stream the blood flows all over your body through these little things called veins the blood will then soon go from your small intestine to other body parts like the heart and brain the molecules are little bits of energy making the other body parts stronger therfore your blood stream is how molecules get around the human body#L-EE
obviously their are many parts in your digestive system however which one is the most important i mean which organ of the digestive system does the most work well that is a very hard answer okay we can get rid of the esophagus right away why well the esophagus brings your food to your stomach but other then that the esophagus really doesn't have a big part up next is the large intestine the large intestine is important to but not as important the large intestine deabsorbs all the liquids in your waste and also brings it to the anus however this organ still isn't the main organ in the digestive system ok so we can technically go on and on about this all day however i'm just gonna type down the organs that don't have the biggest job and explain why appendix no use at all at least a rumor may store good bacteria but is unknown gail bladder stores sugars fats and other items like bile to help break down your food however doesn't have actual use other then storagestomach the stomach does churn the fod into chyme and absorbs it however doesn't make energyliver the liver filters all of the digestive tracts blood the liver does have a very big part of the rest of the body but not the most important organ for the digestive system so important organ but not as much for digestive system as the rest of the body pancreas the pancreas also is very important the pancreas essential roll is to convert are food into fuel for our body which is important however still isn't the most important organ in the digestive system therefore you mightv'e guessed that the most important organ in the the digestive system is the small intestine the small intestine is a very important organ most of our energy is made in the small intestine and it also brings the rest of our waste to the large intestine so the small intestine is the most important organn in the digestive system like you predicted p s if your body didn't have any of these organs you would die#L-EE
when the food enters your mouth it goes down a tube called esophagus and ends up at a place called a small intestine most digestion in done there juices come out of the walls of the intestine what help break down the food into nutrients after the food gets broken down into tiny nutrients the walls of the intestine absorb the nutrients the nutrients get into a bloodstream the blood carries the nutrients into all the different parts of your body#L-EE
there are many different parts in the digestive system here is a list of the different ones and what they each areesophagus the esophaugus is a tube that goes fromyour mouth to the stomach food goes through the esophagus with the hep of your syliva the sylivia helps the food go down the esophagus easier small intestine the small intestine is a part of the digestive system that is very important in the small intestine most or all of the nutrients from the food are brough there the nutrients brake up into pieces of molecules that are small enough to absrob into your blood stream these nutrients are brought to other places including the heart and the brainlarge intestine the large intestine is the place where your waste is made all of the chyme first combineds together then a lot of nwater will need to absorb from the chyme when there is enough waste combined its time for you to go to the bathroom#L-EE
your spine suports your hole back it makes you hole body move stand up stright and bend over and go side to side along with your brain your spinal cord is part of your central nervus system your spine is also a exstention to your brain stem did you no that your spinal cord as long as your finger your spinal cord is made of nurran bundles that cary inpulies from your body to your brain and then your brain to your body your conow contains a special fluied that provides nurishment to the cord sells it also acts like a shock ubsoreber on the survial part of thr spine there are more white matter then other spots because there are lots of information that is traveling back and forth from the brain area of the spine in the lower part of the spine ther is less information exchange and less white matter surounding and protecting the spinal cord that are bones called verabraet not all verabraete are created equal they come in diffrent shapes and sizes based on the posision and function there are 8 cerviacal veribrate over near your neck and 12 thoricoc verabrate near in your uper back and in your lower back you have 5 lumbar veribrite and 5 sacrah veribraete and 1 coccygel verebrate near your tail bone now you see your spne is verry inportent in your bodyi got this from 1 brain pop#L-EE
we can break food up into to was mechanical digestion and chemical digestion mechanical digestion is when you physically break the food apart chemical digestion is when chemicals that are called enzymes breaks the food into molecules so it can let your body absorb it these types of digestion happens in our mouth chewing mechanically breaks apart the food while that is happening enzyme in your spit called salivary amylase breaks down carbohydrates when the food that you are chewing becomes a soft gooey mass that's when your tongue pushes that gooey mass to the opening of your esophagus at the back of your mouth then your esophagus squeezes the food that you ate down into your stomach in your stomach food is churned and mixed with enzymes plus other digestive juices including hydrochloric acid the chemical breaks down proteins and fats in your stomach you have a lining of mucus protects your stomach from the acid for about 4 hours the food that you ate turns into a thick milkshake and that is called chyme the chyme goes into your small intestine which is not small at all it is 7 meters long the small intestine is where most of the nutrients are absorbed from the food in the first part of the small intestine which is called the duodenum digestive juices from the liver and the pancreas join the breakdown mix the liver and the pancreas turn the chyme into a soup of molecules small enough to be absorbed into your bloodstream in your small intestine there are things call villi lining which is inside the small intestine this i makesme think that the digestive system is an important part of your body brainpop#L-EE
what i know is that the heart is made up of four pumps chambers those pumps have an atrium and ventricle each the brain sends a message to the heart to start pumping the left atrium fills up with blood that is squeezed into the ventricle which then pushes the blood out which goes to the lungs for oxygen at the same time the right atrium fills up with fresh blood which is squeezed into the ventricle which is then pushed out into the body to help it circulate#L-EE
"the impulse spreads into the ventricles causing the muscle to contract and to pump out the blood the blood from the right ventricle goes to the lungs and the blood from the left ventricle goes to the body the heart has four chambers "" two at the top the atria and two at the bottom the ventricles"#L-EE
the main purpose of your heart is to pump blood all over your body all of the time your muscles and organs your heart and you would die sixty to one hundred times every minute your heart muscles squeeze together and push blood around your body through tubes called blood vessels#L-EE
"did you know that a baby has 300 bones and a adult has 206 bones if your wondering ''what how does that work"" well it's because when you get older your bones fuse join together for example baby's are born with three seperate upper arm bones when the baby grows the bones will join together feel the end of your nose move it around there is cartilage at the end of your nose that why it's not hard got info from book in skeletal system bin"#L-EE
the brain can do things no one could ever think of did you know that the billions nerve cells inside your brain can control and allow you to think remember see dream hear smell taste and touch another cool fact is that the brain and nerve cells know everything about you to the foods you like and the thoghts you think not to say that it keeps yor heart beating what how crazy is that just think with the help of your brain and nerve cells friends that your brain and nerve cells keep your heart beating also how smart you are does not depened on size for instance if a animal has a bigger brain then you it does not mean theh are smarter smartness is based on the complexity level of your brain the human brain is more complex then any animals i need to understand since our brain keeps are hearts beating does that mean we can stop it throgh thoghts or not my theory is that you can stop your heart with the power of your brain but how#L-EE
the heart is not only important becauseit helps us circulate it also helps us breathe this is helpful because it the blood brings oxygen to the body cells and takes away their carbon dioxide although when we breathe out we release carbon dioxide it does not get rid of all of it so when the right atrium and right ventricle squeezes out blood to go to the lungs that blood removes that carbon dioxide the blood does this by bringing oxygen with itself the oxygen absorbs the carbon dioxide cells#L-EE
when the food goes into your mouth you swallow it after chewing and your esophagus pushes the food down to your stomach it breaks down even more in your stomach after about 4 hours the broken down food is like a milkshake and it is called chyme chyme moves into your small intestine the small intestine is where the nutrients from the food is absorbed the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum dugestive juices fromthe liver brake down the chyme it breaks down into a substancelike soup in your intestine thereissomething called villi andcells on the surface of the villi absorb the nutrients from chyme while the chyme is going through the small intestine then the chyme goes through the large intestine and it is thin and watery by then the large intestine sucks out all the water from the chyme and that process called absorption helpsyou to stay hydrated when it finishes absorbing all the water the waste goes to the rectum and it piles up until you need to go to the bathroom#L-EE
the digestive systemand trachea are very important let's start with the digestive system first the sun will give energy to a seed the seed will grow roots become a sprouting a young adult and then a full grown plant after the plant grows the sun and rain will give energy to the tree the sun and the rain will make food grow foods like nuts oranges berries apples and seeds will grow someday the food could be picked by a human the human will eat the apple which will lead through the esophagus into the stomach the stomachs sides are strong enough to grind the food the groundup food called chyme will go to the small intestine juices from the pancreas and liver will join the chyme in the small intestine the chyme will be broken apart the nutrients in the food you just ate will be broken down into tiny molecules thanks to the juices these molecules are small enough to absorb in your bloodstream the rest of the waste will be brought to the large intestine there your waste will be all piled up the water in the waste will absorb out of the waste when there is enough waste its time to go to the bathroom next will talk about the trachea have you every drunk too much of a drink at once if so someone might say that it went down the wrong tube as a matter of fact it sort of did the drink went down your trachea the drink or food will make it jammed which will start to make you cough the oxygen and carbon dioxide are blocked in the lungs leaving you to cough so the food or drink will get out so you can continue to breathe first you start off with the sun the sun will give seeds energy to grow after the seed is a plant the plant will release oxygen oxygen is the thing we breath in it's not really called air because air is the thing around you when your outside the plants produced oxygen will soon be brought to a human the human will breath in the air which will go through the trachea the trachea is a tube by your esophagus the oxygen will be brought to your lungs a little or as long the lungs need it when you breathe out you are releasing a thing called carbon dioxide#L-EE

my theory we get oxygen from air we breath in the oxygen goes through the thin walls of the air sacs with the help of hemoglobin oxygen passes through the air sacs into the blood vessels throughout the body as that happens co2 goes out of your body oxygen burns the acids and sugars in our blood vessels to produce energy#L-EE
my theory we use air by taking in oxygen from air oxygen enters the lungs then passes through the alveoli air sacs and into the blood the oxygen is carried around the body in blood vessels co2 moves into the blood and is brought to the lungs to be released into the air during exhalation the oxygen rich blood is then transported throughout the body in the bloodstream i need to understand what parts of the body need oxygen#L-EE

nutrients are very important for the human body nutrients are important for many body parts some of these body parts include the lungs the heart and the brain however where do we get nutrients and why are they important well let's take a look at the human body after your food is made into chyme it will go into the small intestine juicesfrom the pancreas and the liver will join the chyme as well in the small intestine the juices break the nutrients from your food apart so the nutrients come from the food you eat the juices break the nutrients into molecules so small that they can be absorbed into your bloodstream your bloodstream flows up and down the body so the molecules can get to different places your blood is brought everywhere in the body so it will be brought to the body parts that need it the most after a while the nutrients will have reached the different body parts why do the nutrients go to the different body parts though well the body parts need nutrients so they can be powered just think of a treadmill a treadmill needs electricity to be powered without the treadmill wouldn't be able to function so whati'm saying is without nutrients your body wouldn't be able to function however why else do we need nutrients well nutrients have many things that make your body stronger one of the things in the nutrients is vitamins calcium and vitamins are located in your nutrients all vitamins are good for your body without them you could be very weak and wouldn't be able to function that great grains are also in nutrients grains are good so your body can become stronger in strength i hope you have the same thoughts as me and i hope you have learned what you need to know#L-EE

new information how long does it take for food to go through the digestive system about six to eight hours digestion time varies between individuals and between men and women after you eat it takes about six to eight hours for food to pass through your stomach and small intestine food then enters your large intestine colon for further digestion absorption of water and finally elimination of undigested food oct 30 2012#L-EE
in people with cf a defective gene causes a thick sticky build up of mucus in the lungs pancreas and other organs in the lungs the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections extensive lung damage and eventually respiratory failure in the pancreas the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients#L-EE
in everyone's body all of your body parts are located in the same place however what if your body parts were mixed up would your body still function the same the answer is that your body wouldn't be able to function at all all but why wouldn't the body function well let's take the digestive systemfor an example if your small intestine was before the stomach the food wouldn't even be able to go down the small intestine what i mean is the food would be too big to go down the small intestine plus the food would need to be chyme to break apart the food itself would be too hard and then the small intestine wouldn't be hooked up to your veins so the other parts of the body wouldn't get any nutrients if the body parts get no nutrients the body parts will be weak therefore if your body parts were mixed up you would die#L-EE

i just learned that there is acids inside of the stomach that really matter if you didn't have those acids the whole digestive system wouldn't function correctly and would cause not being able to absorb nutrients which would make you more lazy or tired or just sit around being halfhearted all day long the acids break down more than before breaking down in the mouth for chemical digestion but the acids are like the leaders of the stomach they break down any food that is able to break down in to really small molecules that fit into the large intestine#L-EE
there are acids in everybodys stomach no matter who you are the acids help break down any food that gets into the stomach kind of like a leader of some type if you didn't have those acids in your stomach that would lead to not taking in nutrients and that would make you a lazy person but for the rest of you who have them don't ask to get rid of them or there will be a catstraphy i need to understand how were the acids sent to the stomach instead of any other part of the digestive system#L-EE
well you first might wonder why we need nutrients well nutrients are very important nutrients have protein grains and vitamins that your body needs without nutrients your body wouldn't be able to function at all in other words without nutrients you'd be dead where do nutrients come from well they come right from the food we eat some foods have more important nutrients but all food normally has some sort of nutrient that is good for you how do we get nutrients to other body parts first the stomach will make a think called chyme chyme is a squishy mix of your food when the chyme goes to the small intestine juices from the pancreas and the liver join the chyme in the small intestine the juices help break apart the nutrients from the food into molecules small enough that can be absorbed into your bloodstream the molecules will then be brought to the body so the other body parts can get the nutrients so nutrients get to other body parts of the bloodstream#L-EE
my theory is you when you chew you breakdown the food 2 ways chemically and mechanicaly mechanic breakdown is when you chew the food physically and chemical breakdown is when things in your saliva called enzymes helps breakdown the food then the food turns into a paste called chyme and gets pushed down your esophages into your stomach and your liver pancreas and gallblatter make acids to help break down the food so it can fit in your other intestines your stomach acids then it goes down duodenum and into your large intestine which absorbs more nutrients from the chyme and also water to make it more compact then it goes into your small intestine absorbs pretty much all of the nutrients and vitamins then goes into to your rectum and you go to the bathroom then it's done and this takes about 23 days#L-EE

white blood cells officially called leukocytes 3 kinds neutrophils look for things that shouldn't be in your body macrophages looks for and digests dead germs and leukocytes lymphocytes b cells carries antibodies for a specific germ the body is immune to that germ until that cell dies t cells helper t cellsthe helper tcells find infected cells and releases chemicals and release chemicals that summon a killer tcell killer t cells that releases a chemical that kills the cell and with it the germs inside red blood cells image kf6 rit albany edu attachments 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5aa7d9cb3a50b25ae16372be 1 031813_lw_blood jpgerothrocytes is the scientific term for red blood cellswhich is the most common type of blood cellssmallest living cell in the human bodythe hemoglobin is protein in the red blood cells that carries oxygenred blood cells also remove carbon dioxide from your body and transfer it to the lungs so you can breathe it outred blood cells are made in your bones inside the marrow which is in your bones they usually live for 120 days then die hematopoiesis#L-EE
my theory all our brain activty starts with the way the brain cells process memory the messeges from the five human sences touch smell hear sight and taste are transformed into shortterm memorys which combined into the long term memory the hippocampus is the part of the brain that transforms the long term memorys into data information the brain is constantly rewriting the stored information and rewires itself in order to be more productive image kf6 rit albany edu attachments 59a4c3ef81a25758f12ed73b 5a7c8a8ae12f2e2c045cb44f 1 hippocampus jpg#L-EE
my theory i also think that you're brain stem is the most important part i think that the brain stem is the most important part because it sends messages back and forth from you're body to you're brain and from your brain to your body if you didn't have a brain stem or if it didn't work like if you got bulbar polio then you're body wouldn't be able to send messages to you're brain and you're brain wouldn't be able to send messages to you're body that could cause a big problem you wouldn't be able to move any part of your body except maybe your head and if you broke a bone or hurt part of you're body your body wouldn't be able to tell you're brain to cry or tell someone that you are hurt which could cause arthritis or other pains when you are older and you could get hurt even more not knowing to rest that part of your body#L-EE
the digestive system is a very interesting part or transaction that the body does to function the digestive system is important for many things there is something called the mechanical break down that is one of the transactions in the digestive system what it does is you yourself has to break down the food manually thats when you chew your food after you chew your food and it completly goes down your asophagus it is the chemicle break down what the chemical break down does is it breaks down the food that you chewed but even more it uses acid that the liver feeds it and the acid tears apart the food in a way so it can go into your large intestine after the two break down parts come the digestive part after the food breaks down in the stomach it then goes through the large intestine collin after that transaction is done it goes into the small intestine the small intestine takes the nutrients from the food and releases it into the bloodstream so you get the energy from the food then it takes th waist and it goes through the colon and out#L-EE
the appendix is nothing really important like i said in my other post it kind of just dangles from the large intestine now even though the appendix really doesn't do anything it can be affective this is called appendicitis appendicitis is mainly super painful however it is also dangerous if not treated quickly the appendix can explode this would lead to tons of bacteria flooding in your body this is called peritonitis these bacteria can cause organ faliure and death if you start to feel pain pain on the body right side of the waste immediatly let a parent or doctor know this way the appendicitis couldn't get that bad some people think appendicitis happens because the waste in your body blocks the bloodstream leading to the appendix now just remember appendicitus is very serious and it's not fun to not let someone know#L-EE
your brain contains the cerebellum cerebrum and the brain stem the cerebrum is split into to different hemispheres the left side of your brain is good at math and language the right side of your brain is for creativity under the gray matter is the limbic system it's full of emotions and feelings it also contains the thalumus the thalumus sends information from your body to the correct part of your brain it also contains the hypothalumus it your temp and food intake without the hypothalumus you would keep on eating and never feel full#L-EE
the brain is made up of millions of active neurons around 100 000 kilometers of active neurons in length on the outer layer of the brain is made out of foulded mental copasity wivh has active neurons that protect your brain this helps because these neurons are the ones that are connected to your eyes to make you be able to see#L-EE
the majority of the outer layer of your brain is made up of foulded neurons and a layer of liquid the placing of theses fouled neronrs is much like a finger print they are different for evrey person there will be and every person there is and was this is one of the reasons that everyone is diffrent this is part of our dna that makes us all diffrent#L-EE
hiv is a disease that attacks lymphocytes that travels through blood and breast milk hiv is contagious it can be spread by breastfeeding and having sex also pregnant women can spread hiv to there children when pregnent hiv is hard to cure because hiv hides in healthy cells even though there dead they look healthy and even when hiv is cured one of those cells can activate and bring hiv is back#L-EE
new information we eat about 500kg of food per year 1 7 liters of saliva is produced each day the esophagus is approximately 25cm long muscles contract in waves to move the food down the esophagus this means that food would get to a person's stomach even if they were standing on their head an adult's stomach can hold approximately 1 5 liters of material every day 11 5 liters of digested food liquids and digestive juices flow through the digestive system but only 100 mls is lost in feces in the mouth food is either cooled or warmed to a more suitable temperature#L-EE
the body is a wonderous place their are so many interesting theories and questions about our oragns bone and blood now lets go back to the organs an organ is a part of your body that has some sort of function there are many organs the heart your lungs your kidneys the brain and many more however how do these organs function the answer is fromenergy energyhelps the body parts function without energy the body would fail and you wouldn't be alive also where does human energy come from well they come from food however how does food become into energy well lets get started first you have to chew food then enzymes in your digestive system will break down the food into many small molecules next many sugars and fats will be made from the enzymes after this you will have adenosine triphosphate atp is a really special type of molecule this is the main molecule that gets the body running then these are brough to other cells by blood in the body to make another molecule the cells will make a molecule called adenosine diphosphate adp also the main sources that make atp are things like carbohydrates taking in more energy from exercising will be stored in your body if you dont get that much energy the stored energy will be used for the body this also depends on if you want to lose weight to lose weight you need to get more energy then it's the oppsite for gaining weight that's all for now bye#L-EE
platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding if one of your blood vessels gets damaged it sends out signals that are picked up by platelets the platelets then rush to the site of damage and form a plug or clot to repair the damage the process of spreading across the surface of a damaged blood vessel to stop bleeding is called adhesion this is because when platelets get to the site of the injury they grow sticky tentacles that help them adhere they also send out chemical signals to attract more platelets to pile onto the clot in a process called aggregation#L-EE
platelets are made in your bone marrow along with your white and red blood cells your bone marrow is the spongy center inside your bones another name for platelets is thrombocytes healthcare providersusually call a clot a thrombus once platelets are made and circulated into your bloodstream they live for 8 to 10 days under a microscope a platelet looks like a tiny plate your health care provider may do a blood test called a complete blood count to find out if your bone marrow is making the right number of platelets#L-EE
the arteries are the blood vessels that deliver oxygenrich blood from the heart to the tissues in the body each artery is a muscular tube lined by smooth tissue and has three layers the largest artery is the aorta the main highpressure pipeline connected to the heart's left ventricle the aorta branches into a network of smaller arteries that extend throughout the body the arteries' smaller branches are called arterioles and capillaries the pulmonary arteries carry oxygenpoor blood from the heart to the lungs under low pressure making these arteries unique#L-EE
your bronchi have tiny hairs called cilia they hold mucus to catch germs and other things that hurt your lungs the unconscious control center in the brain sends a signal to the muscles and inflating the diaphragm and your muscles so when you breathe your lungs can get bigger and get smaller each time you breathe did you know that the diaphragm separates the chest cavity and the abdominal cavity when you eat vegitagle the iron from them goes to your bone marrow so it helps the bone marrow make blood my theory food gives to vitamins and minerals#L-EE
you thought there was one cycle in the heart but you are wrong so this is what happens the inferior venna can takes blood from the lower part of your body and takes that blood and uses it for the heart and then goes to the lungs and take oxygen and goes back to the heart and then takes the oxygen and puts it in the rest of the body and then goes to the heart and then takes the blood through the whole body#L-EE
there are veins in your body almost everywhere there are blue veins and red veins but did you know that the red veins arent actually veins yep theirs a different kind of vein called the artery the artery is different because its thicker than the blue vein and arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body and veins carry oxygenpoor blood back from the body to the heart your body also containsother smaller blood vessels capillaries are tiny thin blood vessels that allow oxygen and nutrients to flow to nearby tissue#L-EE
new information one type of heart holes form between the two ventricles this is called a ventricle septal defect or vsd for short the holes between the 2 ventricles cause oxygenpoor blood to mix wit oxygenrich the main symptom for vsds is a heart murmur a heart murmur makes extra noise because the blood goes through the vsd this allows doctors to diagnose a vsd the problem is that some people have heart murmurs but not a vsd#L-EE
"the thoughts you have in your mind are pretty reasonable to me you brought up a lot of scientific words and important parts in your body that could truly create energy however after adenosine triphophate atp and adenosine diphophate adp is mdae where does it go well atp is sometimes brought to other cells which make adp but where does the rest of the atp go where does the adp go well lets start with atp like you said atp is what energizes your body when you eat atp starts to ""recharge"" the body when atp is made it will sometime br brought to other cells to make adp the rest of the atp is stored in your muscle cells then if your body really needs atp it can be released fats which makes amp adp is stored in your liver now lets say if a blood vessel was hurt this would be bad because now you are bleeding and you are lossing blood however adp will then be released to heal the blood vessel adp also is releaed so your body can move things around this is called muscle contraction that's all for now bye"#L-EE
well you are correct about the liver having many jobs however one thing the liver does is store your energy energy is the thing that keeps your body running after brought down the esophagus the food will be brought into the stomach after that their are enzymes that reak up sugars and fats from your food these fats and sugars will then become a energy source called adenosine triphosphate atp then atp will be brought through your bloodstream into your bodies cells the cells will than make adenosine diphosphate adp then the liver will store adp which is very important your body needs it to stay alive and strong so thanks to the liver our adp is safe#L-EE
everyone's human body has some sort of bad bacteria in it almost all the time bacteria can make you sick or even worse however that's why we have drugs now i know what you think you think that drugs are bad for you which is true however some drugs are good for you this is called medecine medicine helps you from getting sick and from allergies medicine that makes you feel well will make bacteria go away inside medicine their are chemicals that makes the bacteria react in a differnt way your body to will also react differently the chemicals wouldn't be good for the bacteria so the bacteria would then be wiped out#L-EE
i do agree with you about how medicines can be dangerous like you said medicine can be dangerous for you if you take the wrong type however like i said originally some medicines are good for you today we will learn abou how medicines can be good or bad for you like you and i said medicines are good for you during certain times other times they are not well technically all medicines are dangerous if you take to much you can get sick or die however when are medicines good well if your doctor gives you it you can have it you shouldn't share your medicine with other people though well i mean your personal medicine if you bought a bag of vitamin drops however they are a type of medicine good for more than just you you still shouldn't share the vitamin drops though unless your friend knows that the over counter medicine is good for them how do medicines become dangerous the answer to this is that medicines are dangerous when you dont follow the directions if you give someone else your personal medicine they can die if you have to much of your own medicine you can die if you don't take your medicine you can die to prevent yourself from death follow the directions do what your supposed to do and if the medicine is complicated for you please get some supervision therefore medicines are both good and bad for you like you said all medicines are bad for you however medicines can be good for you to they can make you feel better and stay safe that's all for now bye#L-EE
blood is like your body's messenger it takes oxygen and nutrients to every cell in your body what is mostly made inside our bones in a tissue called bone marrow it circulates through the when your blood passes through your lungs what lungs and other parts of your body thanks to the pumping actions from your heart from the heart blood gets pumped to the lungs where it picks up oxygen and travels to the face region of the body in the blood drops off oxygen for the tissues to use it and then it goes back to the heart blood made me look like some sticky red things but it's half of a block of different kinds of upstairs first it has cell the most common is the erythrocytes red blood cells see each of those little things in your body is a blood cell they're red because of oxygen red blood cells contain protein and cooled hemoglobin oxygen connects with your hemoglobin line your blood passes through your lungs white blood cells called leukocytes it keeps you from getting sick they are much bigger than red blood cells and there aren't as many white blood cells also they go and eat your illness another thing i'd like to tell you is one type of blood contains around 50 million blood test 100 000 white blood cells and 2 5 million plates plates are like your safety net for example when you get a cut on your finger it bleeds but plates help to stop the blood from coming out by trying to make it dry blood also contains what's called blood plasma actually blood plasma is the biggest of blood overall it's a clear but yellow substance that's made with almost all water it also has important chemicals and protein like and antibodies to fight infections off#L-EE

well you may be thinking what sphincters are well sphincters are things in your body that keep things like urine in a certain place when many people hear the word sphincters they think of the excratory system every 1015 seconds urine is delivered to your bladder to prevent the urine to go out sphincters hold the urine in the bladder intil you go to the bathroom the sphincters will then be pushed to the side of the urethra so the urine can be brought to the open world in your case when you drink soda the sphincters that block of the stomach from the esophagus is opened every now so the soda can reach the stomach if it all went down at once your digestive system could be affected if you need to burp the sphincters will open letting the burp come up the esophagus that's all for now bye#L-EE
"you are correct but why does our stomach get upset if you think it's stomach bug it could be it but what if it isn't well lets leap into the body say you had a big meal then after you finish it you start to have a stomach ache well it is because of to much food like you stated however why does this happen well i honestly don't know this either but i want to make a prediction i predict that you get a stomach ache if you eat alot beacuase it's to mcuh food for it to handle the stomach has to ""mix"" all of the food into gases or chyme yes the stomach can just get rid of the food by the chemicals and gases in our stomach but most of it is made in chyme plus not much of the food even stays in your body so with more food it puts more stress on the stomach then the process could be slower and the food would be sort of jammed making you feel worse if you really eat al lot and you dont feel really good you might throw up that's all for now bye"#L-EE
what is burping and farting burping and farting is sphineters in the body are like doors they go through one way food liquied they go through the lower esophageal sphincter to the stomach when you drink certain things like soda air travels backwards through the lower esophagel sphincter and up to the esophagus#L-EE
"the liver the second most complex organ in your body besides the brain it dose over 500 jobs for example it proudesesbile another example is that the liver filters out toxionsthat should not be in your body another example is that your liver stores food so when you are low on energy your liver sends out food so you can survive longer have you ever herd someone say ""a human can survive weeks with out food but you cant survive a day without water"" i think thats because your liver has stored food for you however your liver dose not store liquids thats why you can survive so long without food but not without water bile a digestive juice that breakes down fat in the small intestentoxions somithing that is poison bad for youcomplex not simple"#L-EE
the liver is one of the most important internal organs because it is a manufacturer a storage area and proccesing plant the liver stores your blood the blood gives the liver oxygen if your blood has toxins in it then the liver makes it into something that is not harmful to your body or it takes it to the kidneys to be exrected the liver also make bile and it breaks down toxins too bile is part of the digestive system and it breaks down chyme and it gets digested bile gets stored in the gallbladder the liver makes thing that help digestion and it makes blood plasma proteins ot make blood clots and digest fat acids it also makes cholestrol to create hormones#L-EE
the digestive system has a slow prosess when you have eaten a certain amount of food when you eat a small amount of food like a snack it might take a shorter amount of time to digest but if you eat lots of unhealthy foods the helpful germs that help you digest they can start to feed off of your body and then those germs start to die and that is bad#L-EE
