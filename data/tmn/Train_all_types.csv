The Types of Edges.Almost all narrow, grasslike leaves and needles leaves have a blade with a smooth edge, as do many broadleaf plants, particularly those that are native to warm climates. The rubber plant, a common house plant, is a good example of such a plant.
The leaves of many temperate broadleaf plants have small, jagged points called teeth along the blade edge. Birch and elm trees have such leaves. Some plants havehydathodes, tiny valvelike structures that can release excess water from the leaf. The teeth of young leaves on many plants, including cottonwood and pin cherry trees, bear tiny glads. These glands produce liquids that protect the young leaf from plant-eating insects.
Some temperate broadleaf plants -- including sassafras trees and certain mulberry and oak trees -- have lobed leaves. The edge of such a leaf looks as if large bites have been taken out of it.

As part of the first plant family to colonize Earth, the soft beds of mosses that now grace mountain streams and woodlands may have shaped our planet’s history.
Primitive mosses, similar to the hundreds of moss species found in Appalachia, might have triggered two cool periods around 455 million years ago, according to a recent study. Published earlier this year in Nature Geoscience, the study suggests that early mosses clinging to prehistoric rocks sped up the weathering of certain minerals from those rocks.

The main sources of water pollution are, Discharge of untreated Raw Sewage from households and factories, Chemicals dumped from Factories, Human littering in rivers, oceans, lakes and other bodies of water. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one of the main sources of pollution in the water. It is known for its many garbage and plastic.
Every day approximately 8 million pieces of plastic pollution find their way into our oceans. There may now be around 5.25 trillion macro and microplastic pieces floating in the open ocean. Weighing up to 269,000 tons. In developing countries, 70 percent of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into waters, polluting the usable water supply. Polluted water can cause serious diseases some of these water-borne diseases are Typhoid, Cholera, Paratyphoid Fever, Dysentery, Jaundice, Amoebiasis and Malaria. Chemicals in the water also have negative effects on our health. Pesticides – can damage the nervous system and cause cancer because of the carbonates and organophosphates that they contain.Each year 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into US water. While children make up 10% of the world's population, over 40% of the global burden of disease falls on them. More than 3 million children under age five die annually from environmental factors.“Approximately 40% of the lakes in America are too polluted for fishing, aquatic life, or swimming.” “Each year 1.2 trillion gallons of untreated sewage, stormwater, and industrial waste are dumped into US water.” Eighty percent of pollution to the marine environment comes from the land.",L-EE,5cd98878747d9e5f35df1827,Water Pollution,"Emma Codden, Ella Young","5/13/2019, 11:08:42 AM",WaterUnit 18-19 GES,5Kenyonnyon,,

I was also suprised when it was all based on a true story except for some parts. this made me compare to when we had a budget of 100$ and we needed to buy the materials without spending too much and we had to pump it and filter it and it was very hard but I think it was harder for salva becuase he needed the right materials and they were more expensive.",L-EF,5d024d326f2f7559634b0539,A Long Walk To Water: The last chapter,Madison Ericksen,"6/13/2019, 9:18:57 AM",WaterUnit 18-19 GES,5Gagnonagnon,,

L-I,Gazers are very strong and used for a lot of things ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,laser,E-BS
L-I,My theory is that light travels in a wavy straight line ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-BS
L-I,Shadow darkness made when light shines on an opaque nontransparent object If the light shines on an opaque object it is imposable for the shadow to be on the same side the light is coming from unless there is a mirror If there is no light there isn't a shadow So there is a shadow where the light cant reach ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-BS
L-I,The sun is the most important light source ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,stars,E-BS
L-I,Objects that don't give off light are non luminous ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,glow,E-BS
L-I,A flashlight is luminous when on but is non luminous when switched off ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,glow,E-BS
L-I,When an animal gives off its own light its called photoluminescence as in biomasses ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,bio,E-BS
L-I,Chemiluminescence is produced by certain chemical reactions For example glow sticks ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,glow,E-BS
L-I,Electro luminescence is produced by electric discharges For example when silk or fur is stroked or when adhesive surfaces are separated ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,electric,E-BS
L-I,Thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks One of these sources is wintergreen Life Savers If you are chewing one turn the lights of  Look in a mirror while chewing Look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks ,L-EF,,,,,Light Unit,,glow,E-BS
L-I,A rainbow is made up of seven different colors Red orange yellow green blue indigo violet ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS

L-I,and sin is made when mixing green and blue ,L-F,,,,,Light Unit,,pri&sec,E-S
L-I,When we see a yellow rose blue would absorb and green and red would bounce off into our eye which makes yellow ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-I,When we had the class debate I was the only student who was not on a side because my theory was light travels in waves but the waves go in a strait line and the debate was between straight line and waves And now we have lots of ideas from the debate and we don't know which one is right now is light travels sort of like this Light travels in a straight line but appears to be wavy or light travels in waves but appears to be straight That means that light has aspects of both straight lines and waves It depends on how you look at it Or what your experiment is trying to prove In our class we have seen experiments that prove both that light travels in straight lines box with powder and shadow experiments and wavy lines Thomas Young experiment ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-S
L-I,The way you see what color everything is is because of light hitting your eye when their is a green leaf the light hits it before it splits up it is called white light the green leaf absorbs the other colors but the green keeps going because it is the same color The green light keeps going until it goes into your eye Then the brain identifies what color and it is ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-S
L-I,Cones tire easily If you were looking at a green apple the cone that responds to green light gets tired So when you look at a piece of white paper the green cone would be to tired but the red and blue wouldn't and red and blue make purple And purple is the opposite of green on the color wheel ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,postimage,E-BS
L-I,This is why the colors of the rainbow are in the same order As you know there are seven colors that we know of They all travel at a the same wave frequency and they get mixed But when light goes through something like rain the frequency of the light waves get differed For some reason red always has the longest frequency and purple has the shortest ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS
L-I,A thing that involves color and is very magnificent is the northern lights This happens because of magnetic disturbances of the sun The sun sends out particles of electricity that are microscopic The earths atmosphere makes the air electrified and then it glow The colors that glow are red pink and green ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,northern,E-BS
L-I,They also have something called the law of reflection The law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection To clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle ,L-EF,,,,,Light Unit,,reflection,E-S
L-I,But first natural light There are two sections that I am going to write about First photoluminescence Photoluminescence is made from a living thing Like electric sale They make their own light Therefore electric sale are electroluminescent So are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi ,L-EF,,,,,Light Unit,,bio,E-H
L-I,1 Is it true that all we see is light My theory is that all you see is light bouncing off things in to our eyes ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,see,E-BS
L-I,2 How do we see an object that is transparent translucent or opaque Opaque light bounces off it into your eyes ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,see,E-BS
L-I,Transparent solid light bounces off it because it is a solid and you can see it very faintly ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,see,E-BS
L-I,Translucent more light bounces off then transparent but less light bounces off then opaque objects ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,see,E-BS
L-I,1 How do you think light travels My theory is that since light doesn't travel on anything it has to make enough energy to keep going My theory is that there are little wavelets of energy that travel inside bigger straight lines Like a flashlight That also explains why light is hot ,L-EE,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-H
L-I,Reflecting and absorbing say if there was a red rose and red light hit it it would bounce off And blue light hit it it would absorb ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-I,If you want a natural rainbow when it rains the rain drops act like prisms and make a rainbow ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS
L-I,How we see a red flower is it goad through your eye and it is upside down The solution to this problem is that your brain turns it around ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-H
L-I,We did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows First we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows ,L-EF,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-BS
L-I,How do out make a rainbow with a prism the white light goes in to the prism and it splits the light up into 7 different color s and those different colors are the colors of them rainbow,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,prism&rainbow,E-BS
L-I,How you make a rainbow with rain rain acts likes prisms and do the same thing that prisms do ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,rainbow,E-BS
L-I,How you see a yellow rose red and green are reflected and all the other colors were absorbed ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,objects,E-BS
L-I,Water refracting light is when light goes in the water after light is in air the light is bent by the water ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,refraction,E-BS
L-I,An eclipse course when The Earth or the moon blocks the suns light ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-I,A solar eclipse happens when The moon is between the sun and the earth and the moon blocks the suns light ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,eclipse,E-BS
L-I,A shadow is when light is shewn on a opaque object and the shadow is what is behind the opaque object ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,shadow,E-BS
L-I,light travels in all directions I need to understand does light travel in a strait line or something else My theory's that light travels in wave lines but they appear straight ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,travel,E-S
L-I,All we see is light ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,see,E-BS
L-I,if you shine white light on a yellow flower the red and green is reflected and the blue is absorbed ,L-E,,,,,Light Unit,,pri&sec,E-BS

[    My theory  - All our brain activty starts with the way the brain cells process memory. The messeges from the five human sences(touch,smell,hear,sight and taste)are transformed into short-term memorys which combined into the long term memory. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that transforms the long term memorys into data/ information. The brain is constantly rewriting the stored information and rewires itself in order to be more productive.]

[    My theory  - I also think that you're brain stem is the most important part. I think that the brain stem is the most important part, because it sends messages back and forth, from you're body to you're brain, and from your brain to your body. If you didn't have a brain stem, or if it didn't work, like if you got bulbar polio, then you're body wouldn't be able to send messages to you're brain, and you're brain wouldn't be able to send messages to you're body. That could cause a big problem. You wouldn't be able to move any part of your body, except maybe your head, and if you broke a bone, or hurt part of you're body, your body wouldn't be able to tell you're brain to cry, or tell someone that you are hurt, which could cause arthritis, or other pains when you are older.

[    My theory  - I think the Brain Stem is the most important part because the brain stem needs to give info to the Thalamus so the Thalamus can bring the info to the correct part of the Brain. If there was no Brain Stem you wouldn't know that you would be hurting somewhere on your body. Also this connect to Polio, Bulbar Polio attacks the brain stem and the spinal cord, and most people died while having Bulbar Polio. That shows how important the Brain Stem is. I still think other parts are important too. This also is about the spinal cord (I haven't studed that yet). - ]

Autism (AW-tiz-um) happens when the brain develops in a different way and has a hard time helping someone communicate and make sense of the world. The symptoms could be mild,sever or in the middle. Many kids with autism Have a lot of trouble knowing what emotions look like. Some symptoms of autism are Having trouble understanding the meaning of some words. Keep doing the same thing over and over. Move her or his body or arms in a certain way that might not make sense to you. Have trouble adjusting to change no matter how little.(Having a substitute teacher,having toys moved from their usual place or trying new food.) Imagine if you had autism.

Connected to the digestive system is the excretory system. The excretory system is the part of the body where urine is released. Let's start in the large intestine.  In the large intestine, water is deabsorbed from your waste. The water is absorbed in your blood which is brought to either one of your kidneys. In your blood, there is urea. Urea is something that could affect the blood. Other salts and waters are also brought to the kidneys. The reason that the blood doesn't keep the water and salts is because they can affect it, and your blood doesn't really need them anyways. In the kidneys, nephrons take these items out of your blood. All of these items are urine. The urine goes down ureters into the bladder. The bladder is where urine is stored. When the bladder is full, your brain will warn you it's time to go to the bathroom. The sphinchers will move from the bottom of the bladder which will make you go to the bathroom. That's all for now.

Each intestine has a different purpose. The intestines may seem like the same thing, but they each have a different purpose. The large intestine is mainly about where the waste is made, while the small intestine is more used for the nutrients so they can be brought to different parts of your body.
Small Intestine- The small intestine is one of the main parts of the digestive system. First, juices from body parts such as the liver will join the chyme. After that, In the small intestine the nutrients from the chyme will become into small molecules. The small molecules will be absorbed into your blood, and they will be brought to different body parts. Your bloodstream goes up and down your body, so blood goes to many body parts suh as the brain.
Large Intestine- The large intestine is where the waste gets ready to be released. The chyme is brought from the small intestine to the large intestine. After much of the waste is combined, the water will absorb out from the waste. When enough water is absorbed, it's time to go to the bathroom
Therefore, both intestines are very important, but they have a different purpose.

The heart is very important, it's about the size of your fist the heart muscle is very different from other kinds of muscles in your body. The heart never gets tired it pumps oxygen and nutrients but some time desses get in your blood and can affect parts of your body,anyway the heart pumps oxygen and nutrients throughout your body or to the organs and other places in your body that need it,so sell waste products can be removed. The heart is made up of two pumps one on the left and one on the right. The pumps are made out of Atrium and Ventricle, the Atrium brings blood back into the heart and pases it to the Ventricle which pumps the blood back out. This pumping cycle produces you heart beat, for example when the brain sends a signal to the heart, the right Atrium fills with used blood that's been through the body and goes through the body to prevent the lungs move oxygen. The left Atrium fills with fresh blood from the heart and lungs then ready to go back to the body. the Atrium squeezes blood into the Ventricle, below when the blood in your ventricle the valve between the ventricle and the atrium closes and the ventricle pushes the blood out of the heart, the right atrium pumps the old blood to the lungs. The left atrium pumps new blood to the rest of your body so it can circulate, it takes about l minute for it to circulate around your body and back to the heart to be pumped back out again.

Humans get energy by getting food and water into their stomach. However, for the humans to get energy, the food needs to first grow. So let's take an orange for example. First, the sun will give energy to a type of plant. The plant will become a full-grownplant, and then things will start to grow on the plant. The things on the plat are oranges. Then, the oranges will be eaten by a human. However, the human first needs to eat the orange, and then the orange will need to go into the human's body. First, it will go into the esophagus(A "" tube"" that leads to your stomach. Now, the energy is in your stomach, but some of the food will continue to go through the small intestine, and the large intestine which will soon be digested.

I just learned that there is acids inside of the stomach, That really matter. If you didn't have those acids, the whole digestive system wouldn't function correctly and would cause not being able to absorb nutrients which would make you more lazy or tired or just sit around being half-hearted all day long. The acids break down more than before breaking down in the mouth for Chemical digestion but the acids are like the leaders of the stomach, they break down any food that is able to break down in to really small molecules that fit into the large intestine.

When you eat the food, you chew it into a soft sphere that can fit down the esophagus. Once you swallow, your food goes down your esophagus, and lands in your stomach, where acids break down your food. Once that is done, nutrients are extracted in the small intestine. After that... you don't want to know. Once the sugar gets in your bloodstream, it goes inside your cells and into the mitochondria. There, sugar (by the way, it'sC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6) is mixed with oxygen to make energy (adenosine tri-phosphate, or ATP), water and carbon dioxide.</sub>

Molecules get to your brain by the blood stream in your body. In the Small Intestine, the chyme becomes into many little small molecules. These little molecules are small enough to be absorbed into your blood stream. The blood flows all over your body through these little things called veins.

My questions:
Why do we have a certain eye color?
How did we get the eye color that we have now?
Why do we have a certain hair color?
How did we get the hair color we have know?
What I have figured out about my questions so far:
We all have two genes that are color genes. We can have two different color ones, or two of the same color ones. If you have one brown gene, and one a different color, you will have brown eyes and brown hair, because brown genes are more dominant. If someone has brown hair, that doesn't mean that both of their genes have to be brown. If your parent has brown hair, and a brown and a different color gene, and your other parent has the other color two, then you could possibly have that color. You could even have a different hair and eye color than your twin if you have a twin!

Nutrients and vitamins are not only for teeth and bones but muscles also need nutrients and vitamins. Muscles carry energy with them so that they do not get weak all the time. If there is no calcuim for the muscles in your body your body can relese a lot of waste into your muscles and it can also relese a lot of waste into your heart.Sometimes your body can relese a type of fat that is supposed to be waste. So now if there is no calcium in your body and there is no nutrients your body can not survive this type of thing. So that's why your body and your muscles need nutrients.

Nutrients are very important for the human body. Nutrients are important for many body parts. Some of these body parts include the lungs, the heart, and the brain. However, where do we get nutrients, and why are they important. Well, let's take a look at the human body. After your food is made into chyme, it will go into the small intestine. juicesfrom the pancreas and the liver will join the chyme as well. In the small intestine, the juices break the nutrients from your food apart. So the nutrients come from the food you eat. The juices break the nutrients into molecules so small that they can be absorbed into your bloodstream. Your bloodstream flows up and down the body so the molecules can get to different places. Your blood is brought everywhere in the body, so it will be brought to the body parts that need it the most. After a while, the nutrients will have reached the different body parts. Why do the nutrients go to the different body parts though? Well, the body parts need nutrients so they can be powered. Just think of a treadmill. A treadmill needs electricity to be powered. Without, the treadmill wouldn't be able to function. So whatI'm saying is without nutrients, your body wouldn't be able to function. However, why else do we need nutrients? Well, Nutrients have many things that make your body stronger. One of the things in the nutrients is vitamins. Calcium and vitamins are located in your nutrients. All vitamins are good for your body. Without them, You could be very weak and wouldn't be able to function that great. Grains are also in nutrients. Grains are good so your body can become stronger in strength. I hope you have the same thoughts as me, and I hope you have learned what you need to know.

Obviously, their are many parts in your digestive system. However, which one is the most important? I mean, which organ of the digestive system does the most work? Well, that is a very hard answer. Okay, we can get rid of the esophagus right away. Why? Well, the esophagus brings your food to your stomach, but other then that, the esophagus really doesn't have a big part. Up next is the large intestine. The large intestine is important to, but not as important. The large intestine deabsorbs all the liquids in your waste, and also brings it to the anus. However, this organ still isn't the main organ in the digestive system. Ok, so we can technically go on and on about this all day. However, i'm just gonna type down the organs that don't have the biggest job, and explain why.
Appendix- no use at all (at least a rumor). May store good bacteria, but is unknown.
Gail Bladder- stores sugars, fats, and other items like bile to help break down your food. However,doesn't have actual use other then storage
Stomach- The stomach does churn the fod into chyme, and absorbs it. However, doesn't make energy
Liver- The liver filters all of the digestive tracts blood. The liver does have a very big part of the rest of the body, but not the most important organ for the digestive system. So important organ, but not as much for digestive system as the rest of the body.
Pancreas- The pancreas also is very important. The pancreas essential roll is to convert are food into fuel for our body, which is important. However, still isn't the most important organ in the digestive system.
Therefore, you mightv'e guessed that the most important organ in the the digestive system is the small intestine. The small intestine is a very important organ. Most of our energy is made in the small intestine, and it also brings the rest of our waste to the large intestine. So the small intestine is the most important organn in the digestive system. (Like you predicted).
P.S. If your body didn't have any of these organs, you would die.

The digestive system is a very important system. There are many body parts involved in this systeem. The body part that does the most work in the digestive sytem is the small intestine. First, your stomach will make a squishy mixture called chyme. Juices from body parts such as the liver, and the panacreas will also join the chyme. In the small intestine, molecules are made. The molecules are made out of the nutrients from thr food that you ate. To make the molecules, the juices will help the chyme break apart. After the molecules are made, they will be brought to your vains. The molecules will absorb into the blood, which will take the molecules all over the body. The molecules go to body parts such as the heart. What about the rest of the waste, Parts of the food your body doesnt need will be brought to the large intestine. There, all the water absorbs out of the food. When there is enough waste piled up, its time to go to the bathroom.

The digestive system is a very interesting part or transaction that the body does to function. The digestive system is important for many things there is something called the mechanical break down that is one of the transactions in the digestive system, what it does is you, yourself has to break down the food manually. thats when you chew your food. after you chew your food and it completly goes down your asophagus it is the chemicle break down. What the chemical break down does is it breaks down the food that you chewed but even more. It uses acid that the liver feeds it, and the acid tears apart the food in a way so it can go into your large intestine. After the two break down parts come the digestive part after the food breaks down in the stomach, it then goes through the large intestine/collin. After that transaction is done, it goes into the small intestine. The small intestine takes the nutrients from the food and releases it into the bloodstream, so you get the energy from the food. Then it takes th waist, and it goes through the colon and out.

The digestive system is the food processor that is in your body. To start the digestive system, you first have to eat something. then the food will go down your esophagus. The esophagus is a ""tube"" that goes through your throat. Once the food reaches the stomach, the food gets mixed with gases and chemicals. The food will stay here for a littlewhile until the next step of the process. Then there is the small intestine. That is the place where many of the nutrients from the food absorb. Juices from the liver and the pancreas also join the chyme in the small intestine. Then the digestive juices become into small moleculesthat will absorb into the bloodstream. Then eventually, after another process in the small intestine, the chyme will go into the large intestine. A large intestineis a place where many of the water gets sucked out the digested chyme. Thishappens the process named absorption. after most of the water is absorbed, the waste goes to the rectum. Finally, when there is enough waste, you go to the bathroom. This process usually takes 3-4 days. So, that'sis what the digestive system is like.

The digestive system starts when you eat the food then it goes down your esophagus to your stomach, where acids and gases work together to break down the food. But, where do the gases come from? My theory is that they come from the acids, but that is only me. Once the food is broken down, it travels to the small intestine then more acids break down the nutrients even more, than the small intestine absorbs the food, and the nutrients travel to different parts of the body to provide energy, and the food that the body doesn't need goes into the large intestine which compacts the food together then the waste leaves the body. This whole process takes about 26-43 hours.

The digestive systemand trachea are very important. Let's start with the digestive system. First, the sun will give energy to a seed. The seed will grow roots, become a sprouting, a young adult, and then a full grown plant. After the plant grows, the sun and rain will give energy to the tree. The sun and the rain will make food grow. Foods like nuts, oranges, berries, apples, and seeds will grow. Someday, the food could be picked by a human. The human will eat the apple which will lead through the esophagus into the stomach. The stomachs sides are strong enough to grind the food. The ground-up food called chyme will go to the small intestine. Juices from the pancreas and liver will join the chyme. In the small intestine, the chyme will be broken apart. The nutrients in the food you just ate will be broken down into tiny molecules thanks to the juices. These molecules are small enough to absorb in your bloodstream. The rest of the waste will be brought to the large intestine. There, your waste will be all piled up. The water in the waste will absorb out of the waste. When there is enough waste, its time to go to the bathroom.
Next will talk about the trachea. Have you every drunk too much of a drink at once? If so, someone might say that it went down the wrong tube. As a matter of fact, it sort of did. The drink went down your trachea. The drink or food will make it jammed which will start to make you cough. The Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide are blocked in the lungs, leaving you to cough so the food or drink will get out so you can continue to breathe.
First, you start off with the sun. The sun will give seeds energy to grow. After the seed is a plant, the plant will release oxygen. Oxygen is the thing we breath in. It's not really called air because air is the thing around you when your outside. The plants produced oxygen will soon be brought to a human. The human will breath in the air which will go through the trachea. The trachea is a tube by your esophagus. The oxygen will be brought to your lungs a little or as long the lungs need it. When you breathe out, you are releasing a thing called carbon dioxide.

The Eye is about the size of a ping pong ball and is located in the eye socket ( a hollow space in your scull) your eye lid protects your eye and keeps it moist. When you blink your eyelid is keeping the eye moist. You blink a lot, almost 28,000 times a day! Blinking is a involuntary and voluntary muscle. This means that you can blink when ever you want to, but sometimes you do it without even thinking about it. 
Another cool thing about the eyelid is that it has great reflexes. An example is when you step in to a bright room; your eyelids squeeze together to protect your eyes until they can adjust to the bright light . Another example is if you clap in front of your friends face there almost guaranteed to.

The heart is not only important becauseit helps us circulate it also helps us breathe.This is helpful because it the blood brings oxygen to the body cells and takes away their carbon dioxide. Although when we breathe out we release carbon dioxide. It does not get rid of all of it. So when the right atrium and right ventricle squeezes out blood to go to the lungs that blood removes that carbon dioxide. The blood does this by bringing oxygen with itself. The oxygen absorbs the carbon dioxide cells.

The human brain weighs 3 pounds
It comprises 60% of fat and is one of the fattest organs in the human body
Human brain has the capacity to generate approximately 23 watts of power when awake.
Of the total blood and oxygen that is produced in our body, the brain gets 20% of it.
When the blood supply to the brain stops, it is almost after 8-10 seconds that the brain starts losing the consciousness.
The brain is capable of surviving for 5 to 6 minutes only if it doesn""t get oxygen after which it dies.
The blood vessels that are present in the brain are almost 100,000 miles in length.
There are 100 billion neurons present in the brain.
In early pregnancy, the neurons develop at an alarming rate of 250,000 per minute.
As we grow older, we are unable to remember new things. According to the researchers in the US it is because the brain is unable to filter and remove old memories which prevent it from absorbing new ideas.

The Pancreas' Job is to help with digestion. It sends a special juice that is made up of sodium bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. Sodium Bicarbonate neutralizes acidity in the the stomach and it lets the digestive enzymes do its job to break down the food. The pancreas' other job is to control sugar levels in your body. If your sugar level is low then it releases glucagon. And the cells and liver release sugar. If your sugar level is high then the pancreas releases insulin. Insulin tells the liver to stop sugar production. If there is not a balance then you will get diabetes.

There are many different parts in the digestive system. Here is a list of the different ones and what they each are
Esophagus- The esophaugus is a tube that goes fromyour mouth to the stomach. Food goes through the esophagus with the hep of your syliva. The sylivia helps the food go down the esophagus easier.
Small Intestine- The small intestine is a part of the digestive system that is very important. In the small Intestine, most, or all of the nutrients from the food are brough there. The nutrients brake up into pieces of molecules that are small enough to absrob into your blood stream. These nutrients are brought to other places including the heart, and the brain
Large Intestine- The large intestine is the place where your waste is made. All of the chyme first combineds together. Then a lot of nwater will need to absorb from the Chyme. When there is enough waste combined, its time for you to go to the bathroom.

There are more than 25 trillion red cells in the approximately 5.3 quarts of blood found in an average 170-pound man. But the spleen and other organs usually destroy about 200 billion of these cells each day, giving red blood cells in the circulatory system a life span of only about four months. Red blood cells must there fore be produced at a rapid rate, inside the bone marrow.
Blood not only provides food, oxygen, waste disposal and protection from infection, it also closes minor wounds. It does this through the process of clotting, which prevents the body from continuing to lose blood and prevents sources of infection from entering the body. Clotting begins when platelets start to break up around the wound, triggering a series of chemical changes which produce a clotting enzyme. Once the body has begun to heal itself, however, proteins in the plasma dissolve the clots, keeping the blood vessels un obstructed and in good working condition.

Vomit is something that we do have for a reason. Like you said, it is from food poisoning sometimes. Food poisoning can cause you to vomit, but why? Well, if your food is poisoned, it will not be something the body is familiar with. The poison from the food will be affecting the body, which is not good. I predict you throw up to try to get rid of the poison. It could also be a reaction. For instance, if you touch poison ivy you can itch. So, if you eat poison the affect might be to vomit. you would vomit because the poison is affecting you. Jacob has taught me that if you have an allergy, you can vomit because the body thinks the food is poison. If you are allergic to things like gluten, and you eat it, the body might've never seen it. Therefore, the body would think thta it cant keep it. So then you would vomit. However, I got this info from Jacob, so ask him for more info. Like you said we also do vomit because of the stomach bug. When you get a germ, the germ has stuff in it that make you vomit.

We can break food up into to was Mechanical Digestion and chemical digestion.
Mechanical digestion is when you physically break the food apart.
Chemical digestion is when chemicals that are called enzymes breaks the food into molecules so it can let your body absorb it.
These types of digestion happens in our mouth. Chewing mechanically breaks apart the food. while that is happening enzyme in your spit called salivary amylase breaks down carbohydrates. When the food that you are chewing becomes a soft, gooey mass. That's when your tongue pushes that gooey mass to the opening of your esophagus, at the back of your mouth. Then your esophagus squeezes the food that you ate down into your stomach.  In your stomach food is churned and mixed with enzymes plus other digestive juices including hydrochloric acid. the chemical breaks down proteins and fats. In your stomach you have a lining of mucus protects your stomach from the acid. for about 4 hours the food that you ate turns into a thick milkshake and that is called chyme. The chyme goes into your small intestine which is not small at all it is 7 meters long. The small intestine is where most of the nutrients are absorbed from the food. In the first part of the small intestine which is called the duodenum. Digestive juices from the liver and the pancreas join the breakdown mix. The liver and the pancreas turn the chyme into a soup of molecules small enough to be absorbed into your bloodstream. In your small intestine, there are things call villi lining which is inside the small intestine.
This I makesme think that the digestive system is an important part of your body.

Well, you're correct. You're body does need different foods to help you stay alive. What is food you may ask? The answer is any food. Some of the most important food are things like fruits and vegetabales. Fruits and vegetabales are meant to be eaten on a regular basis. Apples for instince, have many vitamins that make them healthy. even the sugars in apples are good for your body. The sugars aren't the best, but they're still good for your body. Jucies however, are different. Many jucies are made from fruits, but many more sugars are added. The apple part is healthy, but the sugars added aren't good for you. Vegtebales are also very healthy. Carrots have many nutrients that make your body stronger. Protien is also very important. Frying meat doesn't make meat healthy, but plain chicken breasts, turkey, grilled steak, and ham are very important for your body. Nuts are also very important to eat. Nuts like Almonds are very strong in protien. Next there's grains. Grains like rye bread, wheat cereal, and pasta are very important. Kellogs claims to make healthy cereal, but there are many sugars in there cereals. Hoever, There are many grains of protien in cereals like Frosted Falkes, Corn Flakes, Special K, and Life. Rye toast is helthy to eat as well with a little butter or cream cheese. Whole grain pastas are also very healthy. Then there's dairy. Milk is always good to drink 1-2 times a day. Yogurts with fruits and granola are also full of many grams of protien. A little cheese is even good to eat every few days. Icecream is a mix of dairy and sugar. Ice cream had dairy and often a few grams of protiwn. However, toppings like sprinkles and cookie dough ruin it all. Butter and cream cheese are even goodto eat every now and then. Finally, Candy and sweets. Things like candy are actually sort of good for you. Candy and cake aren't healthy, but the sugars do help your body function. Having to much of a certain food can make you sick, or killed.

other people have corneas that focus light behind the retina , these people are said to be hyperopic or farsighted .

When the food enters your mouth it goes down a tube called esophagus and ends up at a place called a small intestine most digestion in done there. Juices come out of the walls of the intestine what help break down the food into nutrients. After the food gets broken down into tiny nutrients the walls of the intestine absorb the nutrients the nutrients get into a bloodstream. The blood carries the nutrients into all the different parts of your body.

When the food goes into your mouth you swallow it after chewing and your esophagus pushes the food down to your stomach. It breaks down even more in your stomach. After about 4 hours the broken down food is like a milkshake and it is called chyme. Chyme moves into your small intestine. The small intestine is where the nutrients from the food is absorbed. The first part of the small intestine called the duodenum dugestive juices fromthe liver brake down the chyme. It breaks down into a substancelike soup. In your intestine thereissomething called villi andcells on the surface of the villi absorb the nutrients from chyme while the chyme is going through the small intestine. Then the chyme goes through the large intestine and it is thin and watery by then. The large intestine sucks out all the water from the chyme and that process, called absorption helpsyou to stay hydrated.When it finishes absorbing all the water the waste goes to the rectum and it piles up until you need to go to the bathroom!!

When the stomach digests juices and gases help it. Hydrochloric is a chemical that breaks down food, the hydrochloric acid is so strong that it can make a hole in wood. For the stomach not to digest itself it produces a layer of mucus.

The helper T-cells find infected cells and releases chemicals and release chemicals that summon a killer T-cell...Killer T cells...that releases a chemical that kills the cell and with it the germs inside.

You might've seen people with braces on their legs and you are probably wondering why. Or maybe you weren't, but I'm going to tell you! The person probably had Cerebral Palsy, a disease that may either effect your speech, movement, learning or vision. CP can effect most muscles in your body and the symptoms are very different, even the ones that just effect your legs! If your legs are effected you might need a wheelchair, you might need braces on your legs or maybe you walk on your own with no aids but the way you walk is different. CP is non-progressive, that means that it doesn't get worse or better, an example, if your CP effects your legs than later it won't effect your speech. CP can be caused by early birth or problems at birth but there are many ways to help people with CP and I mentioned one earlier, braces on your legs. You could also get surgery ( That wouldn't help your speech though ), get a computer if you have problems with speech of do phisical theraphy. I hope that you learmed alot about CP!!!

Your conow contains a special fluied that provides nurishment to the cord sells it also acts like a shock ubsoreber.
On the survial part of thr spine there are more white matter then other spots because there are lots of information that is traveling back and forth from the brain area of the spine.
In the lower part of the spine ther is less information exchange and less white matter.

There are 8 cerviacal veribrate over near your neck and 12 thoricoc verabrate near in your uper back and in your lower back you have 5 lumbar veribrite and 5 sacrah veribraete.And 1 coccygel verebrate near your tail bone.

The oxygen rich blood is then transported throughout the body in the bloodstream.

L-I,"[    New Information  - Air traveling is a suprisingly difficult task. Air travels through tissues in the body. Oxygen needs a transpot network (way to travel) in the body. 20 trillion red blood cells come at this time. Each one contains 270 million oxygen-binding (holding together) molocules of hemoglobin. This gives blood it's scarlet color. To make these cells, the body uses a raw matirials that form from the food we eat. Some ways you can say that the oxygen's journey really begins in the gut. Food gets broken down into it's smallest elements of hemoglobin. Iorn is carried through the cardovacular system, to the body's hematoppietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace of red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within our bone marrow cavities. The kidneys control and maintain the rate and speed our levels of red blood cells through the realease of erythropoietin, a hormone whitch causes bone marrow to increase production. ( make more bone marrow.) Our body churns out 2.5 million red blood cells per second, the same number to the entire population of PARIS! That way, the oxygen that makes it's way to the lungs will have a good way to travel. But before the oxygen even reaches the lungs, the brain needs to go into action. The brain stem activates breathing by sending a message to your nevous system all the way to your mucles, diaphram, and ribs. My question about air travel is that does air always travel? Does it never stop? I want to learn more about this.",L-EE,,How Does Air Travel in the Body? -Anuska,Anuska Biswakarma,"1/23/2018, 10:34:17 AM",Human Body 2017-2018,5Kenyon,,

Like you and I said, medicines are good for you during certain times. Other times, they are not. Well, technically, all medicines are dangerous. If you take to much, you can get sick or die. However, when are medicines good? Well, if your doctor gives you it, you can have it. You shouldn't share your medicine with other people though. Well, I mean your personal medicine. If you bought a bag of vitamin drops however, they are a type of medicine good for more than just you. You still shouldn't share the vitamin drops though, unless your friend knows that the over counter medicine is good for them. How do medicines become dangerous? The answer to this is that medicines are dangerous when you dont follow the directions. If you give someone else your personal medicine, they can die.

If your small intestine was before the stomach, the food wouldn't even be able to go down the small intestine. What I mean is the food would be too big to go down the small intestine. Plus, the food would need to be chyme to break apart. The food itself would be too hard.

Mitochondria is used to make energy. Our energy is Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). After ATP is made, it will be brought to our blood stream. The ATP will then go around your body until it reaches a cell. Most of the time, ATP is brought to your muscle cells. Why? ATP is brought to your muscle cells the most because the muscle cells keep ATP to make AMP. AMP can be learned about in the link below. Anyways, the point is that to make AMP you need a ton of ATP, and AMP is ""made"" in the muscle cells. So that's why a lot of ATP goes their. Anyways, back to the topic. When ATP is brought to a cell, mitochondria will come into action. It will break down all of the nutrition, and when it's broken down we will also have a new energy for the body to use. After that, the new energy is now ready to go. It can either be brough to a different cell to be stored, stay in the same cell and be stored, or finally it could be used immediatly. That's all the info for now. Bye.

An organ is a part of your body that has some sort of function. There are many organs. The heart, your lungs, your kidneys, the brain, and many more. However, how do these organs function. The answer is fromenergy. Energyhelps the body parts function. Without energy, the body would fail, and you wouldn't be alive. Also, where does human energy come from? Well, they come from food. However, how does food become into energy? Well lets get started.First you have to chew food. Then, enzymes in your digestive system will break down the food into many small molecules. Next, many sugars and fats will be made from the enzymes. After this, you will have adenosine triphosphate. ATP is a really special type of molecule. This is the main molecule that gets the body running. then, these are brough to other cells by blood in the body to make another molecule. The cells will make a molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Also, the main sources that make ATP are things like carbohydrates. Taking in more energy from exercising will be stored in your body. If you dont get that much energy, the stored energy will be used for the body. This also depends on if you want to lose weight. To lose weight, you need to get more energy. Then it's the oppsite for gaining weight. That's all for now. Bye!

When you eat, ATP is made which than powers up your body. ADP, when made makes your body low ""charged"". The more ATP is used to transform into ADP, the less ATP you have. Than, if your body is low on ATP, it will be stored in your muscle cells. If the ATP isn't used, it's just stored in the muscle cells. ATP is actually your bodies main energy source. AMP is actually ATP, but AMP is when your body needs a sudden burst of energy. Say you were runing a marathon, and you were low on energy. Your stored energy will immediatly be released.

However, after Adenosine Triphophate (ATP) and Adenosine Diphophate (ADP) is mdae, where does it go. Well, ATP is sometimes brought to other cells which make ADP, but where does the rest of the ATP go? Where does the ADP go? Well, lets start with ATP. like you said, ATP is what energizes your body. When you eat, ATP starts to ""recharge"" the body. When ATP is made, it will sometime br brought to other cells to make ADP. The rest of the ATP, is stored in your muscle cells. Then, if your body really needs ATP, it can be released fats which makes AMP. ADP, is stored in your liver. Now, lets say if a blood vessel was hurt. This would be bad because now you are bleeding, and you are lossing blood. However, ADP will then be released to heal the blood vessel. ADP also is releaed so your body can move things around.

Some foods have more important nutrients, but all food normally has some sort of nutrient that is good for you. How do we get nutrients to other body parts? First, the stomach will make a think called chyme. Chyme is a squishy mix of your food. When the chyme goes to the small intestine, juices from the pancreas and the liver join the chyme. In the Small Intestine, the juices help break apart the nutrients from the food into molecules small enough that can be absorbed into your bloodstream.
