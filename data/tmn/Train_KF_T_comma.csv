L-EF,new intrimationthat me and dylan discoverd is that ant colines could have millions of ants there are diferent typs of ants theres 1 queen ant worker ants which are females and there are drones who are males when a termite whol is attact army ants spry a substance tat the attaker will not like ants like to eat friut and other small things i need to understand if ants are decomposers the reason i am wondering if ants are decomposers is because if a apple starts to rot and they eat it is that considerd decomposing
L-EF,my theory is that rain comes into the mushroom which makes the steam or smoke what this theory cannot explain that mushrooms have no holes i need to understand how it comes to there spores is it moss new information about this from brainpop is that when spores or something does a thing called budding that makes it come off the mushroom not really this makes it in my thinking let the smoke come out when you flick it new information more info i have is that the mushroom is called the puffball mushroom new information as of 12 6 18 they dont spur out steam or smoke new information as of 12 10 the puffball isn't a mushroom it actually is a fungi but isn't a mushroom what new information more the smoke or steam is actualy dust like spores so that means that the smoke is actually spores that look like dust i guess i found the answer to my theory or did i new information i see that they get the spores out from getting impacted like the flick i saw at the albany pinebush i guess that's it here is a picture image kf6 rit albany edu attachments 5b87586745b8a02554df72de 5c0ea49ec0c1561fdba72c41 1 screenshot 20181210 at 12 37 47 pm png c 2018 wikipediaa puffball mushroom
L-EF,new information decomposition works when organic substances break down nonliving more simple organic matter foxes deers etc this process helps ecosystems by turning organic matter into enerygy for other plants to grow in soil fungi bacteria and insects are the ones who do this process they're called decomposers

L-F,when i watched a brain pop video i learned that seedless plants have spores spores are kind of like the seeds for seedless plant exept they´re microscphic
L-F,yes exactly thank you its also made from sand and pine nedles
L-F,you also need co2 for photosynthesis
L-F,you should make a biger quashtion because you could just serch that up and mabey you can wach that brain pop video
L-F,you should make your question longer because bees live 122 to 152 days or early bumblebees can live 28 days
L-F,ω soil is a wonder and i've never heard of white soil and anyway soil is used for many things like plants chipmuncks and people
L-F,today we did a water challenge the challenge was that you had to move 100ml of water 100 centimeters to another beaker the challenge was a bit hard at first but when we got a hang of it
L-F,evaporation is water water is steaming
L-F,our plan worked here are our stuff we had 4 tubes 1 3 way valve 6 connectors 2 beakers always and a sringe and a measuring tape
L-F,putting our knowledge together when we worked in teams of 4 3 we made a tube that we could fill water with and we made it to the second challange
L-F,during this experiment i learned it's kinda hard to transfor the water to the cup because you have to come up with a plan etc
L-F,well i guess it could be hard if you did not have a plan but other wise it would not be that hard
L-F,it was fun to do with classmates and easy it didn't really make a big mess for us my questions are can we go longer and can it get harder cuz what we did was easy
L-F,starit was esey up thehoill

L-F,water scarcity happens when a place is too hot like africa the water evaporates more often
L-F,some ways humans purify water are *boiling*iodine*filtration systems*evapration traps
L-F,one way humans purify water is a filtration system another way humans could purify water is boiling the water
L-EF,we need water because 75% of the human body is made out of water and also since plants need water and they give us oxygen and we need water to live and we get the oxygen from the plants and we give carbon dioxide back to the plants so basically almost everything need water
L-F,"putting our knowledge together to build on we all need water to servive you should wach the movie ""holes"" it will really help it gives you information about what will happen if you dont drink water and what will happen if you dont eat for a while"
L-F,wow you can´t we can clean it but making it is a no you can serch that ongoogle but still
L-F,"water scarcity has been happening in the book "" long walk to water"" because in 2008 nyla has to walk the whole morning to get water"

L-F,hi guys sorry if the link doesen't work i am working on it so just be pastiont spelling might be bad
L-F,for this experiment at school that i did at class was that we tried to move water from the ground to the table and we kind of had some mistakes the litle plugs kept coming of and we did not get much water in the first test but on second we improved so it shows me that when you first do somting it does not go well but if your trying again you will succeed
L-F,i think in our group we should have put the tube inside the beaker and put tape around it more
L-F,fish have gills which help them breathe underwater
L-EF,the water sikell is so in porentent for us as humens and us with plastic is so bad for evey thing straerrecycling or we are going toregretted most of our water comes from our oceans which are very dirty there is stillnot much left for the animals and it will be very disgusting cuz i was little pieces of plastic
L-EF,our test diagram was the 3 way vowel on top and the pipe in the water the first test we got 41 ml and the difficulties we had were keeping the pipe in the water and the 3 way vowel we had trouble working it so we wasted some time what we modified we taped the pipe to the cup so it can stay and taped the cup to the table just in case the water we moved was 101 ml our difficulties were turning the thing on the 3 way vowel fast our controls pulling and turning the thing on the 3 way vowel and the thing that was hard and not fair was you can not touch the other things in enrichment some people went outside to get water they got a bit of water the people inside got more and we had to put it on our heads
L-F,my group put the coffee filters inside the cups and we put the carbin in it and poored the water in it was clean but it was blue next time i would only put a little bit of the carbin and a little bit of the water
L-F,the bule sand like stuff is the fertilizer
L-F,our groups plan was1 white filter2 white filter with activated carbon3 brown filter4 white fiterunfourtunaly our plan took out most of our nitrates wre taken out but our nitrate level was about 50 nitrates so in that case our water was still unsafe to drink
L-F,our groups desigened work we use white fiter then carbon and brown fiter next time we wont pour too much dirt water in the carbon so it wont go on the table
L-F,in class we had to filter water with a coffee filter and we learned that if you double the coffee filter over it will do better against the dirty water
L-F,to reflect on todays science expirement i know that i should use carbon as the second step instead of the first
L-F,so i think that our 3 part filter was good but we messed up on the actived carbon because we did not put in a filter so the water would just stay there
L-F,when we made the filter we used the w filter a carbon and then b filter when we filterd the water it turned out clear
L-F,when i did the thing which you have to try to turn the dirty water into clean it was kinda hard because my group sometimes fight but we did it but we thought we could use more of the active carbon but that made the water cloudy and dirty it clean before we use all the active carbon
L-F,yesterdayi puriefed water first you do the white filter and then you do the a carbon and after that you do the brown filter that's how you get a really good score
L-F,during the filtering expriement we did i learned that if we add to much a carbon it turns the water all black and cloudy in conclusion don't put a lot of a carbon in the water to filter it
L-F,when we first filtered our water it still had some bule in it from when it was dirty but when i was cleaning up i realised that it looked cealer it had no more color my theory is that filters work better over time
L-F,today we tested how much toxin was in dirty water and there was so much of it i will continue
L-EF,"when we did our latest project it was about filtering water unfortunetly our water was gray i think it was becuase of too much air carbon we used it in two of our steps instead of one next time we need less carbon and also switch the steps around filtering water is important because nya's sister got sick from drinking dirty water my theory is that she got sick because there are actually nitrates in dirty water an nitrates aren't good for the human body new information that i want to learn is ""what chemicals are in nitrate and how are they bad for us to drink and how are they made exactly """
L-F,new information i learned was that with my group we saw way to filter wateruseing coffe filters it was so fun because when where doing the project and i saw that we were all having fun in the processe we also saw that we learned from our mistakes we had clear water but we though that it coud be more clean so we added more carbon and the clear water with the left over dirty water but it didn't turn out as planed so thats all i have to tell you about my team project i hope i tought you all something
L-EF,in the last chapter ofa long walk to water salva visits schools to talk about the project and to raise money but then it skips two years ahead to 2009 nya looks at a man holding up a poster uncle read it out and now they have clean water as soon as i found out my prediction was that the man was salva and he was doing his project there and i was right but i also found out years ago salva's tribe was in war with nya's i know this becuase nya said that salva had different markings scars on his face also when nya got the clean water she was looking at the clarity of how it was so clear this made me compare it to when we were filtering the water and how it was a little bit more clear after i was also suprised when it was all based on a true story except for some parts this made me compare to when we had a budget of 100 and we needed to buy the materials without spending too much and we had to pump it and filter it and it was very hard but i think it was harder for salva becuase he needed the right materials and they were more expensive
L-EF,i know that there is water in the ground it is called ground water if the people in africa drank groundwater would it be bad for them i made this theory by knowing that the ground has dirt would people in africa be drinking dirty water of would it be clean this theory cannot explain how the dirt is filtering the water because the soil has nitrates and the water nya was drinking could have been bad for her because of thr high nitrate levels
L-F,good for salva he did what he wanted he did what was wright for his people
L-F,my class and i finsh the booka long walk to water an it was really good we should really build pipes around places where people cant get water
L-EF,the water cycle starts in a lake water evaporates and goes into clouds cloud gets dark nd fall of water and rains on land or lakes water travels through underground water ends up in the lake when land meets a lake
L-EF,there are two parts of a shadow a umbra dark part which is in the middle and penumbra light part is on the outside part
L-EF,lasers are a very very strong source of light they are so hot that they can cut through metal bars with ease diamond sellers cut simmonds which is one of the hardest substances on earth
L-EF,transparent means full se through so nontransparent means opaque non see through
L-EF,aura borealis commonly none as the northern lights are a form of colored light is usual found in the north pole but it can go south like to france or italy the natives feared them because they thought they were evil things
L-EF,photoluminescence is when an animal makes it one light fact over 70 of the worlds deep sea fish are photoluminescence fireflies are also photoluminescence
L-EF,photoluminescence is when creatures in small dark places can make them selfs viable for example fire flies have photoluminescence and their is this kind of fish that has a little light on its head
L-EF,those are the colors of your eye cones what i mean by your eye cones is you have eye cones is that you have cones in your eyes that are shaped like ice cream cones by mixing them you get the secondary colors
L-EF,the secondary colors of light are made by mixing the primary colors of light here are the secondary colors of light yellow magenta and cyan here is how their made
L-EF,the northern lights are branches of colored light in the sky you can only see them in the north pole but some times you can see them in muskox in the winter
L-EF,a transparent object is something you can see though like stephanie light can go right though it
L-EF,a translucent object is some thing that you can kind of see though like paper paper is sort of dark sort of light
L-EF,when you have two light sources facing on one thing and there turned on you see two shadows and the same thing happens when you have three light sources are there but three shadows appear
L-EF,if you add light to a prism it should change the white light into the colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue violet and indigo
L-EF,my understanding of natural and artificial light is that living things make there own light like fireflies squids bacteria and fungi 70 present of the worlds deep sea fish make their own light
L-EF,lasers can burn through the hardest substance like diamonds the hardest things on earth laser can burn thousands of holes in 1 day
L-EF,the law of reflection is that if you shine light at a 90 degree angle it will be reflected as a 90 degree angle the light ray that egos to the flat mirror is called the incident ray and the ray that bounces off is called reflected ray
L-EF,its used in things like flashlights if we didn't use concave mirrors in flashlights it would be like a candle
L-EF,convex lens with light rays will concentrate light making a focus point that is the most concentrated and after that it starts to get less concentrated
L-EF,i also learned that light can not go through an opaque object because it isn't transparent
L-EF,another one of the things i learned was that in ancient times people used sundials to tell the time they could tell that the higher the sun was in the sky the shorter the shadow
L-EF,when light hits a double convex lens it travels together and hits and the light is concentrated at the focal point
L-EF,lasers are very bright and they can burn through anything in the world it can burn through steel and chrome and cloth and iron and metal and everything
L-EF,when white light goes through a prism it will make a rainbow all the colors that come out of the prism will be rainbow colors
L-EF,chemiluminescence turns chemical energy into light i used to have glowing stars and a moon on the top of my closet so that is an example of chemiluminescence
L-EF,making a rainbow with rain is when its raining lightly and the sun is out an example is when you turn on a sprinkler and the sun is shining
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection when an incident ray hits a 40 degree angle it will come out a 40 degree angle
L-EF,a translucent object is not see through that means that you cant look through it but a little light can come through a translucent object can be a pace of paper and an mica computer
L-EF,a concave mirror has a sort of cave shape we have mirrors that are flat the mirror that i am talking about is that mirror but pushed in this mirror looks like a bowl when you look into it you see a long shape of yourself
L-EF,a convex mirror is the very opposite this mirror is pushed out this mirror looks like a belly as we gr 4 call it a belly mirror when you look into one of these mirrors you see yourself up side down
L-EF,concave lens heal near sided people see far sided the light rays goad through the eyes and connect at the back of the head
L-EF,lasers are very bright and very strong they can go through anything if you put a red balloon inside a a white balloon and shine a laxer on it the balloon will pop
L-EF,to make white light is to shine blue light red light and green light shine all of the colors in the same spot then you will see white light here is a picture to make it more simple
L-EF,light can be diffused when light is shone and hits a bumpy mirror and reflects and the light spreads out like a concave lens whits is called diffused reflection
L-EF,to make a rainbow withs prism is simple just get a prism and go outside then hold the prism in the air and you'll see a rainbow but sometimes you can not see all the colors
L-EF,co lours of light you can make white light by mixing red green and blue primary colors of light light together
L-EF,the secondary colors of paint are orange green and violet and they are the colors that the primary colors make when they mix each other
L-EF,there are three rinds of eye cones in your eyes they are red green and blue they are sensitive to objects that are either yellow red green blue cyan or magenta
L-EF,the gilt rays from a convex lens go inwards into a point that point is the meeting place of the light
L-EF,your eyes can adjust to darkness after a few minutes in pitch blackness in a movie theater the movie has light on the screen but it isn't very bright but at least you can see the outlines of the people that you are sitting between
L-EF,the angle incidents equals the angle of reflection
L-EF,a defuse reflection happens when light hits a bumpy mirror
L-EF,you have three eye cones in your eyes one is red and one is green and one is blue they are all sensitive to there own colors
L-EF,when light hit a concave mirror the light rays go everywhere but when light rays hit a convex mirror they act normally
L-EF,you have three eye cones a blue cone a red cone and a green cone the red cone is sensitive to red light the green cone is sensitive to the green light and the blue cone is sensitive to blue light
L-EF,we have 3 different eye cones the 3 eye cones are 3 different colors those colors are red green and blue
L-EF,a concave mirror looks like a bowl when light hits a concave mirror it bounces of like in the picture below
L-EF,there is some thing called the law of reflection the law of reflection on a flat mirror is when the light bounces of the mirror at the same angle it came on to the mirror
L-EF,a diffused reflection happens on a bumpy mirror its when all the light goes in lots of directions
L-EF,objects that give off their own light are called luminous objects light sources don't have to be natural to be luminous the sun is luminous as well
L-EF,cones are things that respond to colored light there are three kinds of light that cones respond to red blue and green
L-EF,light is the colors of the rainbow compressed to make white light a prism splits up light into separate colorsred orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-EF,there are different names for the colors of light those names are the primary colors of light and the secondary colors of light there not just named orally the primary colors are the first colors that make up the secondary colors
L-EF,the primary colors are red blue and green the same colors as your eye cones
L-EF,a convex mirror is shaped like a belly and a concave mirror is shaped like a cave
L-EF,a concave mirror concentrates the light and a convex mirror does the opposite
L-EF,a convex mirror since it spreads the light out lets you see more of the stuff behind you a concave mirror since it concentrates light lets you see close up concave mirrors are used by doctors to see up close
L-EF,you can add another lens to one of those lenses also a double concave lens would spread out the light and a double convex would concentrate the light
L-EF,there are two kinds of light natural and artificial natural light is light from a natural light source and artificial light is something that is made from a artificial light source like light bulbs
L-EF,the second thing is fluorescence that is made with friction like when two stones rub together they make fire whits is heat and light that is fluorescence
L-EF,news flash if you put a red balloon inside a white balloon and shine a laser at it the laser will pop the red balloon but the white balloon will be unharmed
L-EF,and umbra is made when you shine a light source over an object that is bigger than the light source that makes a big shadow that is pretty darker
L-EF,a penumbra is when you shine a light source on something that is smaller than the light source that makes a little umbra and a penumbra which is lighter
L-EF,eye cones are things that are in your eyes and they see every thing is upside down the image goes threw the eye cone and to the brain and the brain turns it rightsize
L-EF,fl you want to make a rainbow you put a prism down and you shine a flashlight at it all the colors will come out the other side
L-EF,an umbra is a dark shadow and a penumbra is a light shadow for instance if a light is really dim you will have a penumbra if the light is sting its an umbra
L-EF,shadows on the earth are not completely black but the shadows on the moon they are
L-EF,the rainbow is made up of colored light the colors of the rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
L-EF,there are three eye cones in our eyes and the colors are red green and blue
L-EF,a concave object is is pushed back and if you look into a concave mirror you see yourself upside and
L-EF,a convex object is pushed out and if you look into a convex mirror you see yourself right side up but you are very large
L-EF,when colored light is shined at a opaque object the shadow is black like a normal shadow but when you shine two colored lights there are two shadow and the colors are the colors of the light
L-EF,sundials are a form of telling time you can tell the time by the position of the shadow
L-EF,shadows also are used to tell directions like north and south you also look at the shadow and that will tell you the direction you are walking in
L-EF,a concave mirror is a mirror that goes in and when light is shewn on it the light gets focused
L-EF,a convex mirror is a mirror that goes out and when you shine light on it the light bounces off straight looking
L-F,all of the secondary colors mixed together equals white light

L-F,you cant forget flat mirrors there sort of in the middle flat mirrors are pretty important to
L-F,that law only works for smooth mirrors though
L-F,on bumpy mirrors the reflected ray would go in all directions that is a called a diffused reflection
L-F,now lenses there are two kinds of lenses concave and convex just like the mirrors they do the same things
L-F,lenses are transparent
L-F,there are two other forms that translucent and opaque
L-F,a transparent object means see through
L-F,a translucent object colors the light and
L-F,an opaque object means that it stops the light completely
L-F,now artificial light first chemiluminescence chemiluminescence is when chemicals react to make light
L-F,then there are lasers lasers are extremely bright and very strong they can go through anything
L-F,there are two different ways you can play with shadows one is an umbra and the other is a penumbra
L-F,those are the small the things to do with shadows but there are much bigger things those things are eclipses there are two eclipses that we know of solar and lunar

L-EF,a convex lens is a lens that consent rats the light beam so when you look at the sore it will be a dot
L-EF,thats the ope sit of a concave lens it makes the light sored out you so if your flash light wont sored out then you can holed up a concave lens to the sore of light and it will sored out and cover a larger area but with less power
L-EF,the angle of incidents equals the angle of reflection that mens if you shine a light sore on a flare mirror then the angle you shewn the light on the mirror is the angle it will reflect
L-F,if you shin a light on a crumpled up puce of tin fowl then the light will be every where thats called defuse reflection
L-EF,a concave mirror is a spoon like mirror if you walk away from it you mig is upside down but if you walk closer then its right side up

L-F,an umbra is the dark shadow
L-F,a penumbra is the light shadow
L-F,water bends light
L-EF,most lenses focuses light so if a weak but large source of light is being produced and you put a lens under it then it will make the weak light focus and become strong
L-F,some lenses make light spread out
L-F,there are many types of lenses there are glasses magnifying glasses and many many more
L-F,there are primary colors and secondary colors the primary colors of light are red blue and green
L-F,red and green make yellow light
L-F,green and blue light make cyan
L-F,and red and blue make magenta
L-F,and all three make white
L-F,and the secondary colors are magenta cyan and yellow
L-F,rainbows are light colors you can see
L-EF,you make a rainbow with a prism if you put a source of light in front of a glass prism you usably don't see a perfect rainbow mane not even a rainbow but sometimes you can see a small rainbow
L-EF,when light hits a flat mirror at a 20 degree angle it goes out of the flat mirror at a 20 degree angle this means the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence so light if it goes in at any number angle it will come out at the same angle but this only works with a flat mirror
L-F,if you use it with aluminum foil thats all crumpled up then light will go out at all sides this is called a diffuse reflection
L-EF,there are many types of mirrors there are flat mirrors which in the last paragraph is the only type of mirror that will make light go out at the same angle that it came in a flat mirror is the most comment mirror
L-EF,but there are two more basic ones one is the concave mirror this mirror looks like a cave it goes in and bounces light inside it
L-F,unlike convex mirrors convex mirrors can bounce off many sides those are the basic mirrors
L-EF,if a shiny thing like tin foil is there but bent the law of reflection doesn't work the light goes all over the place
L-EF,convex mirrors make your vision all you can see in the area bigger so if you look in a convex mirror you will see a lot more behind you thees are used in places like cars
L-EF,your eyes cant fully adjust to the dark but they can a bit my eyes have never fully adjusted to the dark but i have had light near and it was dark because i was near a lot of light then it suddenly changes my body wont react too fast but it can wait a few seconds and it will think i have benn there long enough but with no light i don't think your eyes can adjust to a perfectly dark room
L-F,opaque transparent and translucent are some terms in light opaque means that its non see through
L-F,translucent means that some light can go through but not all so part see through
L-F,to see a white shrift glow you need purple light
L-F,chemiluminescence is the chemical that make things glow

L-F,the primary colors of light are green red and blue
L-F,yellow is made by mixing green and red
L-F,magenta is made by blue and red
L-F,and cyan is made by blue and green
L-F,this is how we see white we mix red blue and green all together make white
L-F,an opaque object is something that you cant see though at all like a base ball or a baseball bat
L-F,a concave mirror is a mirror that has cave the image looks like your head is bent
L-F,a convex mirror is something that looks like somebodies belly the image looks like your head is bent out ward
L-F,the law of relation is when the angle of incandescence the angle of reflection
L-F,when light hits a bumpy surface its rays are reflected every where

L-F,on a camera there is a convex lens to help focus the light when the light gos though the lens it gets concertinaed
L-F,my understanding of shadows are that shadows are always on the other side of the light source
L-F,the closer you get to the light the bigger your shadow gets
L-F,and the complete black area is called umbra
L-F,and where its grey is called penumbra
L-F,my understanding of the primary colors of light are red green and blue
L-F,but the primary colors of pigment are yellow blue and red
L-F,blue and green makes cyan
L-F,red and blue makes magenta
L-F,and red and green makes yellow
L-F,of course if you were in pigment yellow would be green
L-F,every person has eye cones that are sensitive to a servant color each eye con is sensitive to either red blue or green
L-F,try clewing one eye then switching one eye looks more red the other more blue since we don't have a third eye we see blue and red and not green because in pigment its replaced with yellow
L-F,the northern light are the color red eerie green and pink
L-F,chemiluminescence is when chemicals make things glow like luminescent paint
L-F,fluorescence is when something is giving off light while getting energy from another source
L-F,my understanding of transparent objects is that if you look at it you should see through it roughly a transparent object is usually like a window some toys and glass
L-F,opaque is a thing that you can see and see through but its fuzzy an opaque object is like plastic
L-F,a concave mirror when light is shown into it reflects the light all around and then up
L-F,solar panels can make lots of things do stuff
L-F,translucent object let some light but not all light through so translucent would be like frosted glass or clouds
L-F,an umbra is a small light source that makes a dark shadow
L-F,also the farther you walk away the longer your shadow will get
L-F,when light hits a double concave lens unlike the double convex the light will go further apart
L-F,i learned that a magnifying glass can focus the light more than it can when the light is just by itself
L-F,another thing i learned was that 70 of the worlds sea fish use photoluminescence to make themselves glow
L-F,photoluminescence is when a animal gives of its own light

L-F,the northern lights are branches of light color that usually found in the north pole
L-F,an umbra is the darker part of a shadow
L-F,and the penumbra is the lighter part of a shadow
L-F,a lunar eclipse is when the sun goes in front of the moon
L-F,and a solar eclipse is just the reverse of a lunar eclipse
L-F,and red and blue makes magenta
L-F,and finally green and blue make cyan a shade of blue
L-F,the secondary colors of light are the colors that the primary colors make when mixing each other
L-F,transparent means see through transparent objects are ice and water examples

L-F,a unbar is a dark shadow
L-F,a penumbra is a light shadow
L-F,when a small light hits an nontransparent object it makes an umbra
L-F,when a larger light hits the same nontransparent object it makes an larger shadow then before and that is called an penumbra
L-EF,when two different colored lights hit an nontransparent object it makes two different colored shadows one that is on one side of the nontransparent object and one that is one the other lets say that the two different colored lights where red and green and you shined those lights on each side of an nontransparent objects ball one shadow will be green and the other will be red but on either side of the nontransparent object
L-F,an opaque object is an nontransparent object but in an scientific way
L-F,i also understand that the shadow is always on the parasite side of the light source
L-F,the closer you are to the light source the bigger your shadow is
L-EF,there are many theories about light there is the straight line theory that is when light travels in straight lines only there is also a theory that is called ripple waves that is when you tutu still water and it makes ripple waves the man that discoverer ripple waves was christian huygens the other theory is the combo theory that is when the waves are in the straight lines and there is the cancel out theory and that is where the straight lines cancel the waves
L-F,i all so know that when light goes in to a different medium it bends more like air and water those are different mediums

L-F,when light hits a convex lens it focuses the light and then speeds the light
L-F,a concave mirror takes in light and dress it out
L-EF,the next view is the co lours of light view with rainbows a rainbow is created when white light hits though a prism and makes a rainbow you can also diffuse a rainbow by letting the light make a rainbow and put another prism beside and it and it creates white light again
L-F,the primary colors of light are bluebeard green
L-F,the primary colors can be made into the secondary colors
L-F,the secondary colors are reacknowledgment
L-F,and agreeableness
L-F,and bluejacket
L-F,and the secondary colors all mixed into one makes white light
L-F,all we see now to the all we see is light view a myriad of notes agree on that you can only see with light
L-F,photoluminescence is light created by animal
L-F,to make white light you need to mix all the primary colors together
L-F,to make a rainbow with a prism you need to shine light through a prism and it makes a rainbow
L-F,there is a thing called a color wheel
L-F,there are cones in your eye they are sensitive to colored light
L-F,if you stare at a picture of a green frog for 10 seconds then stare at a blank sheet of paper you will see a red frog
L-F,there are three different types of materials opaque translucent and transparent
L-F,opaque means nothing can pass through it
L-F,translucent means that it is see through but is colored
L-F,transparent means it is completely see through
L-F,a concave mirror focuses the light inward
L-F,a convex mirror focuses the light outward
L-F,de fussed reflection is like this
L-F,a convex lens focuses the light outward on the other side of the lens
L-F,a concave lens focuses the light inward on the other side of the lens
L-F,fluorescence is when a object is emitting a glow while getting light from another source
L-F,a laser is so very very strong it can cut through anything
L-F,a umbra is a dark shadow caused by a small light source
L-F,a penumbra is a light shadow caused by a big light source
L-F,our class has many theories about how light travels we have 5 theories 1 ripple 2 wave 3 wave in tube 4 particle 5 straight
L-F,there are 3 different theories about how light effects how we see the two theories are your eyes can adjust to light they cant and you see only the outlines
L-F,my understanding of light in natural and artificial light even though i am a master of that view i know that stars are made of gas not fire i found that interesting because before i read those notes i thought that stars were made of fire and only planets were surrounded by gas
L-F,i also learned lasers can cut through absolutely anything even diamonds
L-F,also i learned that 70 percent of the underwater animals use photoluminescence i also found this interesting fungi and bacteria use photoluminescence
L-F,a umbra is the darker part of the light that you may shine anywhere you see the umbra when the light hits something
L-F,the penumbra is a lot like the umbra but is the lighter part
L-F,in light and materials i know that a transparent object is see through
L-F,a translucent object is sort of see through
L-F,and opaque is non see through
L-F,you can see more in a convex mirror than a concave mirror
L-F,the law of reflection is when the indecent ray hits the flat mirror the reflection ray bounces back
L-F,a diffuse reflection is when light hits a something bumpy and the light goes everywhere
L-F,in co lours of light it talks about the primary colors of light are red blue and green
L-F,and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and cyan
L-F,if you mix the primary colors of light you get white light
L-F,if you shine light through a prism it makes a rainbow
L-F,the northern lights are usually found up north people used to be scared of them
L-F,there are two types of shadows the umbra and the penumbra
L-F,the umbra is a small and dark shadow you will get when you use a small light sours
L-F,the penumbra is a lighter shadow around the umbra you get the penumbra when you use a large light
L-F,you can use shadow to tell time with a sundial
L-F,and the primary colors of paint are red yellow and blue

L-F,the northern lights are also called the aurora borealis the aurora borealis is light there are lots of colors in the aurora borealis
L-F,there are 3 ways to describe an object the 3 ways are transparent translucent and opaque
L-F,a transparent object is like glass you can see through it
L-F,a translucent object is an object that is ike sand falling through water light can go through it
L-F,an opaque object is like peter light cant go through him
L-F,a convex mirror looks like the picture above on the right
L-F,a convex lens focuses the light
L-F,a concave lens speeds out the light
L-F,there are 4 come types of luminescences photoluminescence chemiluminescence electro luminescence and thermoluminescence
L-F,things that glow are called fluorescence
L-F,gazers are very strong and used for a lot of things
L-F,the sun is the most important light source
L-F,objects that don't give off light are non luminous
L-F,a flashlight is luminous when on but is non luminous when switched off
L-F,when an animal gives off its own light its called photoluminescence as in biomasses
L-F,chemiluminescence is produced by certain chemical reactions for example glow sticks
L-F,electro luminescence is produced by electric discharges for example when silk or fur is stroked or when adhesive surfaces are separated
L-EF,thermoluminescence is different souses that glow by friction and can create blue sparks one of these sources is wintergreen life savers if you are chewing one turn the lights of look in a mirror while chewing look in your mouth and you will see the candy brakes up in to blueish green sparks
L-F,a rainbow is made up of seven different colors red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
L-F,the primary colors of light are blue green and red
L-F,and the secondary colors are yellow magenta and sin
L-F,yellow is made when mixing green and red
L-F,magenta is made when mixing red and blue
L-F,and sin is made when mixing green and blue
L-EF,they also have something called the law of reflection the law of reflection is the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection to clarify that if light hits a flat mirror at say a 75 degree angle it is going to come off the mirror at a 75 degree angle
L-EF,but first natural light there are two sections that i am going to write about first photoluminescence photoluminescence is made from a living thing like electric sale they make their own light therefore electric sale are electroluminescent so are glow worms squids fireflies and even bacteria and fungi
L-EF,we did an ensnarement with different colored projector lenses and an opaque ball handing from the sling and we saw shadows first we saw 1 shadow when we terned on 1 light there was a dark shadow when we turned on 2 lights there were 2 light shadows and uprise surprise when we toned on all the lights there were 3 light shadows
